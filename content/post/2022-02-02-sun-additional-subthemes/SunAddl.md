The subthemes of Sun discussed above derived from a [a poem complaining about the Sun’s interruption](Donne), a painting with the [Sun over olive trees](Olives), a song punctuated by melancholy [sunrises](Tequila), and a movie with roasting in [desert heat](Arabia). Here are two more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Records </span>: In the realm of the Sun, highests, lowests, and other superlatives abound.  Here are a few: 

Highest recorded temperature on Earth: On September 13, 1922, 136°F was recorded at El Azizia, Libya. [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/month-climate-history-earth%E2%80%99s-hottest-temperature)

Longest night:  In the northernmost town in the world, Ny-Ålesund, on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, the Midnight Sun lasts for 131 days or so, from about April 17 to August 26.   [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/midnight-sun.html)

Brightness of the Sun:  For each square meter on Earth, it lavishes 127,000 lumens.  16.24 quintillion lumens of sunlight hit here every second. [Kogalla]( https://kogalla.com/blogs/tech-trail/how-many-lumens-is-the-sun)

Brightest star: Sirius, the “Dog Star,” in winter; Arcturus, in the constellation of Bootes, The Herdsman, during the summer, which is the fourth-brightest star visible from Earth.  [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2021/08/14/whats-the-brightest-star-in-the-summer-night-sky-no-its-not-the-north-star/)

Number of stars visible by the naked eye:  Upper end estimates total about 10,000 visible stars, while other estimates place the number closer to 5,000.  [Earth Sky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-stars-could-you-see-on-a-clear-moonless-night/)

Largest star: UY Scuti, a hypergiant with a radius around 1,700 times larger than the Sun.  [Space.com](https://www.space.com/41290-biggest-star.html)

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Expressions </span>:  Below are figurative sayings that relate to the Sun.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes, see [Work Additional Subthemes](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-02-26-workadditional/workperspective/).  For this collection of 27, aside from identifying candidate expressions myself, I drew particularly on [English by Day](https://englishbyday.com/sun-idioms/).  It struck me, by the way, that fewer metaphorical expressions exist for “sun” than one might think, given its importance.

<!--Here are the sayings.-->

a place in the sun (a successful or desirable position)  
a touch of the sun (a mild sunburn)
