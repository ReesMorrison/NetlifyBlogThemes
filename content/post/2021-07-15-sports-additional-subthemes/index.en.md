The preceding sections consider concepts of Sports that arise from a painting of [race horses](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-07-12-sports-from-racers-before-the-stands-a-painting-by-edgar-degas/sportsdegas/), a movie about [Olympic exploits](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-07-12-sports-from-chariots-of-fire-a-movie-about-the-1924-olypics/sportschariots/), a song with a [boxer metaphor](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-07-12-sports-from-the-boxer-a-song-by-simon-garfunkel/sportsboxer/), and a poem about the death of a [young champion](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-07-12-sports-from-to-an-athlete-dying-young-by-a-e-housman/sportsathlete/).  Other subthemes don’t fit closely to any of those works of art.

**Games vs. Sports**:  The website [Steemit]( https://steemit.com/sport/@sportspodium/how-many-sports-are-there-in-the-world) claims that roughly 200 sports have an international governing body and that an estimated 8,000 sports are played worldwide.  Still, what is a “sport” as compared to a “game”?  Both terms refer to a pleasure, an entertainment for participants, spectators, and followers.  My sense is that the basic elements that define a “sport” rest on a significant physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes for pleasure, entertainment, or gain.  

It follows from the emphasis on physical fitness and sustained exertion that sitting to do something entertaining falls short of “sports.”  Hence, no gambling activity would be a sport.   Nor would activities that place a premium on mental exertion, such as chess, checkers, backgammon, poker and bridge, because they lack the constitutive requirement of physical rigor, even though it wears a person down to compete for hours at a high level.  Sports as I think of them make you sweat profusely, suck in oxygen, and tire you out.

But what about darts, shuffleboard, cornhole, skeet shooting, miniature golf, billiards, and Frisbee golf? They and many other activities certainly call for skill and mental concentration, but not much physical exertion.  Contestants may sweat from heat or stress, but do their muscles ache at the end? In the end, the term “sports” encompasses more than one continuum on multiple dimensions (competitive, metabolically tough, difficult to master).  It defies crisp definition.  Here are a few hard-to-categorize activities that many consider to be a “sport”:  archery, auto racing, bowling, cheerleading, diving (yet we honor All-Americans), hiking, fly-fishing, scuba diving (competitive?), sky diving, target shooting, and trampolining.

Many sports match a person (or team) against a person (or team); others pit a person against nature (e.g., hunting, fishing, mountain climbing, rock climbing, surfing, and white-water canoeing).   In the major global sports, humans compete only against humans, but other activities that would generally be deemed sports involve animals, such as the Iditarod dogsled trek or horse races.   Finally, physical “games” appeal to children: hopscotch, tag, hide and seek, jump rope, capture the flag, and blind man’s bluff are not complex, challenging, or physically demanding; children love them, but from the teen years on they fall aside. 

**Esports**:   In the last decade, tens of millions around the world have enjoyed playing online games such as League of Legends.   Players undergo grueling, intense preparation to reach the top flights. Teams compete for millions of dollars of prize money, in arenas crammed with thousands of paying viewers in person and countless others watching the contest stream online.  College teams compete against each other and award scholarships.

**Expressions in General Use**:  Phrases that originated in sports have been adopted in English for widespread use.  From my own efforts as well as from [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sports-jargon-in-the-workplace/), [Lingoda](https://blog.lingoda.com/en/20-popular-sports-idioms-in-english/), [My English Teacher](https://www.myenglishteacher.eu/blog/sports-idioms/), [English Live]( https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/english-in-the-real-world/english-idioms-sports/), [7ESL]( https://7esl.com/sport-idioms/) as well as [Phrases](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/sport-and-games-phrases.html), here are more than 110 sayings from a sport that have entered general use outside the sports’ setting.
