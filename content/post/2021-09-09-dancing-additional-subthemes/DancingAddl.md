The subthemes of Dancing discussed above arise from four works of art: a [movie soaked in fine dancing](Rain), a Roethke poem of a [father’s vigorous dancing](Ode), a seventeen-year-old girl who [loves to dance](ABBA), and a [Renoir](Renoir) of a French couple on the  dance floor. We have a few more subthemes to present.

**In Art and Literature**:  We could write at length on dance scenes from novels, such as those in *Emma* by Jane Austen, *Ethan Frome* by Edith Wharton, *Anna Karenina* by Leo Tolstoy, or *Invisible Man* by Ralph Ellison.  Musicals and plays roll out dance scene, such as in *Mary Poppins*, *West Side Story*, or *Grease*.  Operas favor dance scenes, as in Bizet’s *Carmen* with the Habanera, Richard Strauss’s *Arabella*, Verdi’s *La Traviata*, Johann Strauss’s *Die Fledermaus* or the appropriately named *Un Ballo in Maschera* by Verdi. Classical music even has pieces that honor dance, such as *Danse macabre*, a tone poem for orchestra written by Camille Saint-Saëns and *Invitation to the Dance*, a piano piece written by Carl Maria von Weber.

**Records**:  As is our custom, we can present a small set of the most, the biggest, the oldest and other superlatives associated with Dancing.  

Earliest evidence - The oldest proof of existence of dancing comes from the 9,000-year-old cave paintings that were found in India, which depicts scenes of hunting, childbirth, religious rites, burials and most importantly, communal drinking and dancing.
