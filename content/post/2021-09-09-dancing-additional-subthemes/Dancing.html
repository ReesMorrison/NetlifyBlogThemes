<h2>Dancing, from “Singin’ in the Rain,” a movie starring Gene Kelley and Debbie</h2>
<p>Reynolds</p>
<p>The dance numbers in <em>Singing in the Rain</em> have reached iconic status. Particularly, Don Lockwood’s (Gene Kelly) flamboyant and romantic traipsing through the rain expresses his valentine for Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds). Who minds the rain if you’re in love and can dance spectacularly? More themes of Dancing follow from this movie.</p>

<p><strong>Physical and Mental Exertion</strong>: Especially if you stay on the floor for several hours of an evening with <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-dancing-queen-a-song-by-abba/dancingabba/">young partners</a>, dancing works every muscle. Legs mostly, but with good posture and frequent turns your heart will thank you and you will become more fit. In fact, the average person burns 300-800 calories for each hour of dancing according to <a href="https://captaincalculator.com/health/calorie/calories-burned-dancing-calculator/">Captain Calculator</a>. The number depends on your weight as well as the intensity and style of dance.</p>
<p>Some dances make no bones about being strenuous, such as tap dancing or modern dance. No one can do the hustle for an hour without heating up. Other dances, such as the waltz, call for balance and vigor over the hours. Skillful dancing also demands mental concentration. The leader must guide the couple on the floor and anticipate the moves to come; the follower needs to adroitly pick up signals and execute smoothly, often doing most of the flashy turns and spins. <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-09-dancing-from-dance-at-bougival-a-painting-by-pierre-august-renoir/dancingbougival/">Teamwork</a> and sensitivity to the other requires concentration and experience from both partners.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Accomplished dancers and professionals are proud and paid to strut their stuff. They may do so in a ballet such as Swan Lake, a classic for such legends as George Balanchine, Rudolf Nureyev, and Mikhail Baryshnikov, or in a modern interpretive dance with the likes of Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham They may put on tap-dancing spectacles or a drumming, driving Riverdance. Bollywood films feature dancing, lots of wonderful solo and ensemble pieces, including such stars as Hrithik Roshan and Madhuri Dixit. Shakira, to name one more sensation, can shake a leg (and hips) with gusto. Dance performances take place everywhere around the globe. In the United States, Michael Jackson may be best known for his unique ‘moonwalk’’ (a far cry from <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-my-papa-s-waltz-a-poem-by-theodore-roethke/dancingroethke/">clomping in the kitchen</a>) but more broadly he won the admiration of millions with his eye-popping dance moves. John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever” did his flamboyant, dramatic best to win a trophy. Others may shine as break dancers, buskers on a busy city street. Movies, such as <em>La La Land</em> or <em>They Shoot Horses Don’t They</em>; song videos, and TV shows, such as “Dancing with the Stars,” feature graceful, exciting, and perfectly choreographed numbers. It was not only Bo Jangles who could dance for a living.</p>
<p><strong>Instruments and Bands</strong>: The tunes in <em>Singin’ in the Rain</em>, particularly the wet Kelley, become ear worms. However, we may not pay attention to the instruments that complement the dancing. For swing bands in that era, dancers hear trumpets, saxophones, keyboards, double basses, and drums. Now, electric guitars, drum machines and pads, samplers, saxophones, and synthesizers are the five most common instruments for today’s social dances, as explained by <a href="https://iedm.com/blogs/onblast-edm-blog/top-5-instrumentals-in-dance-music">iedm</a>. Even so, disc jockeys with record collections often replace live bands. For most dancers, the fundamental instruments are drums: They provide the base, the foundation on which the rest of the music and the twinkle toes on the floor thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unable to suppress his love for Debbie Reynolds, Gene Kelley breaks into an endearing cavort down a rainy street. Despite the exertion the moves require, he gracefully, creatively and emotionally dances his heart out. The celluloid performance is immortal.</p>

<div id="dancing-from-dance-at-bougival-a-painting-by-pierre-august-renoir" class="section level2">
<h2>Dancing, from “Dance at Bougival,” a painting by Pierre-August Renoir</h2>
<p>Renoir’s canvas, Dance at Bougival, glows with a young couple in the close embrace of a slow dance. Behind them, others at the outdoor event in that small French city are watching, talking and socializing while the two lovers are caught up in the intimacy of the music and the tender moment. What are other themes of Dancing we can pick out from this painting?</p>
<!--more-->
<p><img src="C:/Users/Rees%20Morrison/Documents/R/Projects/CLIENTS/Themes/BlogThemes1/static/media/DanceBougival.jpg" alt="Dance at Bougival" /> Dance at Bougival in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA.</p>
<p><strong>Norms and Styles</strong>: We can only conjecture what moves these two young people are dancing around the floor (from their frame and arms, it is not a <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-my-papa-s-waltz-a-poem-by-theodore-roethke/dancingroethke/">waltz</a>). Perhaps they are simply swaying and turning in a free-form style. If they were au courant, they would have been stepping out to the latest favorite. At the time of this painting (1883), Europe favored waltzes, polkas, mazurkas, and a few other dances. But every decade, country, and social strata favors a few dance steps. New dances become popular, older dances fade away. And all dances evolve.</p>
<p>Types of dances not mentioned elsewhere under this theme include tango, salsa, samba, breakdance (a type of dance with acrobatic moves done to hip-hop music), ice dancing, Irish dance, and folk dance. To bring the point home on the staggering variety of this entertaining activity, the International Encyclopedia of Dance covers six volumes and 4,048 pages.</p>
<p>As a side note, dance crazes have periodically flared on the social scene in the United States. A sample of them in chronological order would include these fads from <a href="https://www.insider.com/most-popular-dance-the-year-you-were-born-2019-4#1923-the-charleston-1">Insider</a>: 1923, the Charleston; 1934, the jitterbug; 1941, the Lindy hop; 1942, conga lines; 1953, the hokey pokey; 1958, the hand jive; 1960, the twist; 1962, the limbo; 1963, the watusi; 1964, the jerk; 1977, the hustle; 1996, the Macarena; 2012, Gangnam style; on up through twerking in 2013, and flossing in 2018.</p>
<p><img src="C:/Users/Rees%20Morrison/Documents/R/Projects/CLIENTS/Themes/BlogThemes1/static/media/DancingTravolta.webp" alt="Travolta" /> John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever.</p>
<p><strong>Dress</strong>: Certainly the young woman, the <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-dancing-queen-a-song-by-abba/dancingabba/">Dancing Queen</a> of this painting, is very proud of her fancy dress. When people trip the light fantastic on Friday or Saturday night, they choose outfits that fit in with the place, their fellow partyers, and their personality. For high school proms, tuxedos and boutonnieres rule for the boys and classy gowns and fancy heels are de rigueur for their dates. Ballroom dancers put on special shoes to protect varnished floors and let them slide their feet, swishing large skirts show up in country-style dances, while disco balls blinked down on big shoes, bell bottoms, chest hair, and sparkles galore or for women, tie-dyed shirts, a peasant blouse or skirt, or a halter-top. Of course, dancers who anticipate <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-singin-in-the-rain-a-movie-starring-gene-kelley-and-debbie-reynolds/dancingrain/">rain</a> on their street customarily bring umbrellas. Much of the allure and attraction of social dancing is how the dancers dress. It’s a stage on which they can show off, preen, indulge in vanity – to match the excitement of the moment, the music, and the hope for romance.</p>
<p><strong>Associations with Nations</strong>: In France, during the centuries before Renior memorialized this scene, people enjoyed dances that now only historians would recognize: branle, menuet, musette, pavane (as in Ravel’s, Pavane for a Dead Princess), forlane, galliard, and saltarello count among the extinct steps. Meanwhile, a medley of dances have come to be associated with a particular country. For example, Kathak as Indian, Yangko as Chinese, squat dances for Russia, the waltz in Germany or Austria, tango from steamy Argentina, an array of square dances in the United States, Morris Dances represent England, Gangnam style speaks of South Korea, or the Flamenco reminds us of Spain. Styles of dance around the world have evolved to express the histories and social sensibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This vertical impressionist painting brings us into the courtship of a French couple. They are slow dancing, holding each other closely, oblivious to the spectators around them, and enjoying affectionate romance. Their step was undoubtedly local and familiar (if not ad hoc hugging and gliding to the music), and likewise what they were wearing was in line with the times. To the experienced eye, the combination of moves and clothes marks them as late 19th century French.</p>

<div id="dancing-from-my-papas-waltz-a-poem-by-theodore-roethke" class="section level2">
<h2>Dancing, from “My Papa’s Waltz,” a poem by Theodore Roethke</h2>
<p>Theodore Roethke’s short poem, “My Papa’s Waltz,” recalls exuberant evening frolics in the kitchen with a Papa who is slightly tipsy. The energy, the affection, the playfulness of the clumsy dance, frowned on by Mother, remains vivid for the little boy. The poem engenders other sub-themes of Dancing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The whiskey on your breath<br />
Could make a small boy dizzy;<br />
But I hung on like death:<br />
Such waltzing was not easy.</p>
<p>We romped until the pans<br />
Slid from the kitchen shelf;<br />
My mother’s countenance<br />
Could not unfrown itself.</p>
<p>The hand that held my wrist<br />
Was battered on one knuckle;<br />
At every step you missed<br />
My right ear scraped a buckle.</p>
<p>You beat time on my head<br />
With a palm caked hard by dirt,<br />
Then waltzed me off to bed<br />
Still clinging to your shirt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section" class="section level1">
<h1><poem lyric end></h1>
<p><strong>Ceremonies</strong>: Contrary to good child-raising technique, the boisterous dad gins up the small boy just before he <em>waltzed me off to bed.</em> We surmise that that was a frequent form of horse-play in the household, nothing special, but a long-remembered, small, father-son ceremony: the off-to-bed waltz. In addition to <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-09-dancing-from-dance-at-bougival-a-painting-by-pierre-august-renoir/dancingbougival/">social dancing</a>, a wide variety of notable events include dancing. Many wedding parties in the United States start with a father-daughter and mother-son turn around the floor. Almost certainly the reception party fills the dance floor with celebrants. Wedding parties and dancing go together like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Multi-day Indian weddings also feature dancing as do such celebrations as bar and bat mitzvahs. In all these special events, reluctant or eager young attendees find themselves on the floor. Let us not forget Inaugural Balls.</p>
<p><strong>Rites</strong>: Readers appreciate that the poem represents more than just clomping around the kitchen table; the symbolic, emotional act by the father, deeply felt by the son was a familial rite. Ethnographers and other social scientists have chronicled numerous examples of rites among indigenous people dancing for a purpose. They might have been praying for fertile crops or plentiful buffalo, seeking rain, honoring a new chieftain, warding off evil or disease, or commemorating a rite of passage. For example, originally, the hula was a mimetic, religious dance performed by trained dancers before the king or ordinary people to promote fecundity, to honor the gods, or to praise the chiefs. Nothing like a celebratory rite that turns into a bacchanalia to get folks dancing!</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>: No one dances a capella; instead, music, energizing, frantic, or soothing, sets the tempo for dance moves as it touches our inner chord. Music can be hypnotic as it permeates your body and sets the metronome for the fun. It is the pulsing continuo that the feet and body follow.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-dancing-queen-a-song-by-abba/dancingabba/">Dancing Queen</a> feels acutely</p>
<p><em>Night is young and the music’s high</em><br />
<em>With a bit of rock music</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>music’s high</em> alludes to the intoxication and dopamine rush of a catchy tune plus a fetching partner – or the song and the tune in a <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-singin-in-the-rain-a-movie-starring-gene-kelley-and-debbie-reynolds/dancingrain/">downpour</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A father and a son waltzing around a kitchen before bedtime, Roethke’s imagery makes vivid the energy, the affection, and the emotional force of this nightly far-from routine. It became invested with the status, the mythic role, of a rite even if the music was only his father’s humming and head percussion.</p>
<div id="dancing-from-dancing-queen-a-song-by-abba" class="section level2">
<h2>Dancing, from “Dancing Queen,” a song by ABBA</h2>
<p>ABBA’s catchy hit, <em>Dancing Queen</em>, brings us into an eagerly anticipated Friday night where a teenage girl yearns to sparkle and be sultry under the disco ball. Dancing gives her freedom, self-expression, and power. Enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8O79uP0JmM">performance</a>!

<p>Ooh<br />
You can dance<br />
You can jive<br />
Having the time of your life<br />
Ooh, see that girl<br />
Watch that scene<br />
Digging the dancing queen</p>
<p>Friday night and the lights are low<br />
Looking out for a place to go<br />
Where they play the right music<br />
Getting in the swing<br />
You come to look for a king<br />
Anybody could be that guy<br />
Night is young and the music’s high<br />
With a bit of rock music<br />
Everything is fine<br />
You’re in the mood for a dance<br />
And when you get the chance</p>
<p>You are the dancing queen<br />
Young and sweet<br />
Only seventeen<br />
Dancing queen<br />
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah<br />
You can dance<br />
You can jive<br />
Having the time of your life<br />
Ooh, see that girl<br />
Watch that scene<br />
Digging the dancing queen</p>
<p>You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on<br />
Leave ’em burning and then you’re gone<br />
Looking out for another<br />
Anyone will do<br />
You’re in the mood for a dance<br />
And when you get the chance<br />

<h1><poem lyric end></h1>
<p><strong>Enjoyable</strong>: The <em>dancing queen</em> exults in her time on the dance floor. She flourishes, <em>Having the time of your life</em>. Such is the power and pull of dancing: it is flat-out fun. It’s also often free, as folks dance around the living room or in the street. Dancing gives people a way to meet, enjoy others, and be caught up in the moment while expressing their mood to throbbing music. The memories of being whirled around by your <a href="Roethke">father</a> in the kitchen never leave you. Rules are minimal, flexibility is maximized, and the atmosphere of the dance floor can be electric.</p>
<p>Small kids prance, hop and spin when they are excited and happy; grown up kids, <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-singin-in-the-rain-a-movie-starring-gene-kelley-and-debbie-reynolds/dancingrain/">perhaps transported in the rain</a>, let it all hang out and forget their cares. Just dance! Snoopy of Peanuts fame flaps his ears and leaps! Nearly everyone finds happiness dancing, and some of us revel in it. Creative, expressive, together or apart – to dance is to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Sensual</strong>: Dancing for pleasure can be stimulating for the dancer, a turn-on for the partner, and arousing for observers. The nubile Dancing Queen likes being lusted for:</p>
<p><em>You’re a teaser, you turn ’em on</em><br />
<em>Leave ’em burning and then you’re gone</em></p>
<p>In its twirls, bends, and reaches, in the swirl of hair and dramatic turns, bodies show off their charms and physical attraction comes into full play. There can be excitement unselfconsciously delighting other or conscious exhibition and teasing. Slow, holding tight or <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-09-dancing-from-dance-at-bougival-a-painting-by-pierre-august-renoir/dancingbougival/">cheek to cheek</a>, smoldering, raising pulses and body heat – dancing is sexy.</p>
<p>To pulsing lights and primitive beats, swaying, sweating bodies, and clinging clothes add even a little alcohol – not to mention MDMA (ecstasy) or other club drugs – and you’re caught up in the rave and electronic dance music scene. The hypnotic ambiance winds everybody up. It can be foreplay set to music. Even more risqué, explicitly erotic dancing may be the among the world’s oldest form of entertainment: belly dancing, pole dancing, striptease to music, leggy can-cans, and the biblical Dance of the Seven Veils by Salome for Herod II come to mind. They all exploit rhythm, enchanting movement, and good-looking bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Dating and Courting</strong>: Countless couples have met and become smitten with each other on the dance floor.</p>
<p><em>You come to look for a king</em><br />
<em>Anybody could be that guy</em></p>
<p>“Asking the girl to the dance” is a time-honored step early in many courtships. High schools (oh, the days of sock hops!), youth groups, religious organizations, colleges, and others host dances where shy boys eventually screw up the courage to ask girls to the floor. The girls can’t wait to get started and groove to the music, but the boys? – “Well, my heart went”boom" when I crossed that room, And I held her hand in mine.” (Beatles, I Saw Her Standing There]. For younger teens, mingling clumps of both sexes dance collectively, but pairs eventually separate themselves.</p>
<p>Proms are, well, prominent as the culmination of high school social life. In traditional, chaperoned dances protocols governed of courtly invitation and escort onto the floor and off; in the 18th and 19th centuries, elaborate etiquette governed behavior at grand balls. Young women filled in their dance cards in spaces for “engagements,” as explained on <a href="https://www.americanantiquarian.org/Exhibitions/Dance/etiquette.htm">American Antiquarian</a>, which explains that era and lists hundreds of dances. The Dancing Queen and millions of others have looked for romance from a dance. Even today, in some circles, a cotillion is a formal ball to introduce debutantes to the social world (just a bit dated).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A young girl, only 17, throbs with excitement as she awaits a night of dancing. She loves the freedom of movement and expression, never gets tired even with the most energetic moves, cherishes the sexl appeal that she radiates, and hopes in an undefined way to meet the boy she will love. This is a danceable song about the joy of dancing.</p>
<div id="additional-subthemes" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Subthemes</h2>
<p>The subthemes of Dancing discussed above arise from four works of art: a <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-singin-in-the-rain-a-movie-starring-gene-kelley-and-debbie-reynolds/dancingrain/">movie soaked in fine dancing</a>, a Roethke poem of a <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-my-papa-s-waltz-a-poem-by-theodore-roethke/dancingroethke/">father’s vigorous dancing</a>, a seventeen-year-old girl who <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-10-dancing-from-dancing-queen-a-song-by-abba/dancingabba/">blossoms when dancing</a>, and a <a href="https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-09-dancing-from-dance-at-bougival-a-painting-by-pierre-august-renoir/dancingbougival/">Renoir</a> of a French couple on the dance floor. We have a few more subthemes to present.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>In Art and Literature</strong>: We could write at length on dance scenes from novels, such as those in <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen, <em>Ethan Frome</em> by Edith Wharton, <em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy, or <em>Invisible Man</em> by Ralph Ellison. Musicals and plays roll out dance scene, such as in <em>Mary Poppins</em>, <em>West Side Story</em>, or <em>Grease</em>. Operas favor dance scenes, as in Bizet’s <em>Carmen</em> with the Habanera, Richard Strauss’s <em>Arabella</em>, Verdi’s <em>La Traviata</em>, Johann Strauss’s <em>Die Fledermaus</em> or the appropriately named <em>Un Ballo in Maschera</em> by Verdi. Classical music even has pieces that honor dance, such as <em>Danse macabre</em>, a tone poem for orchestra written by Camille Saint-Saëns and <em>Invitation to the Dance</em>, a piano piece written by Carl Maria von Weber.</p>
<p><strong>Records</strong>: As is our custom, we can present a small set of the most, the biggest, the oldest and other superlatives associated with Dancing.</p>
<p>Earliest evidence - The oldest proof of existence of dancing comes from the 9,000-year-old cave paintings that were found in India, which depicts scenes of hunting, childbirth, religious rites, burials and most importantly, communal drinking and dancing. <a href="http://www.dancefacts.net/dance-history/history-of-dance/">Dance Facts</a></p>
