“The Bellelli Family” by Edgar Degas

This painting of a family includes on the upper-right mantelpiece an ornate, framed and prominent clock.  The Bellelli family should have been proud of this clock, proudly looming over the writing desk and with the grand mirror of the living room behind it, as it was not only functional but also a decorative statement of modernity and affluence.  We can glean from this painting’s notable clock several ideas about time.

**Passage of Time**:  Since antiquity, painters have included symbols on their canvasses to deepen their expressive messages.  Symbols allow viewers who understand them (or respond to them) to “read” the meanings of the painting.   For example, a portrait with a skull or an extinguished candle nearby would be a memento mori, a symbolic reminder that we all die.  Here, the timepiece subliminally nudges viewers of the painting to acknowledge the rapid passing of childhood.  The two Bellelli girls grew older every day and the proud parents could [never go back](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-from-groundhog-day-starring-bill-murray/timegroundhog/ ) and relive their earlier years.  While years slip by nature’s grand objects may show few changes, such as mountains, rivers, and large trees, adults age perceptibly and children transform far more quickly. 

**Time With the Family**:  The most common reason given when executives, politicians, and other hard-driving sorts step down early is “to spend more time with the family.”  And, as the saying goes, no one announces on their death bed, “I wish I had spent more time at the office.”  This painting of the affluent and contented Bellelli family would have serves for years as their reminder of the primacy of good time with the family.  For most of us with spouses, relatives and offspring, when we are with them we are happy and [time passes quickly](http://bit.ly/3rDgShS).  The impressive clock symbolizes the satisfying familial years.

**Punctuality**:  Clocks help keep us on time.  That statement now is obvious, but for millennia farmers and herders responded to the sun, the roosters, the weather, and [the seasons](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-from-turn-turn-turn-by-the-byrds/timeturnturn/) rather than to any artificial precision of hours and minutes.  Even sundials were approximate.   However, in developed countries, a vast number of activities need to be synchronized with varying degrees of precision.  At the extreme, we keep the world synchronized with ultra-precise atomic clocks.  If a jetliner has 24 minutes of fuel left, the pilot needs that reading to be correct and quick.  GPS measurements depend on the tinies intervals of time and distance.  Our world is calibrated chronometrically.  

**Integral to Commerce**: Supply chains and process maps, scheduled departures and minutes to microwave, just-in-time management and train schedules, overnight delivery and quarterly reports.  Everything in commerce depends not just on companies meshing schedules but also on carefully calibrated manufacturing and servicing.  Hair colorings need two hours but no more to keep the salon humming; the iron ore needs 10 minutes at a certain temperature to create pig iron.  The term “downtime” is a pejorative for slack, wasted manufacturing processes.  For employees, punctuality is the cousin of punching a clock.

Nestled in the back of a cozy family grouping preens a fancy clock.  It signifies awareness of time in the heartbeat of a family, and hearkens to the wider world of modernity that needs to coordinate commerce and life by stopwatch accuracy and adherence.
