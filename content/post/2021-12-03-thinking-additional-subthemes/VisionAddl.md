The subthemes of Eyesight discussed above came to mind from a [a poem about blindness in a poet](milton), a painting of [an opera house and spectating](opera), an assertion of panopticon vigilance](police), and a movie with [eye witnesses to a crime](rear).   Here are more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Records**:  Run your eyes over a sampling of superlatives related to eyesight.

* Best human vision -- 20/10 vision, the ability to see objects clearly from 20 feet when a normal human can only see them at 10 feet.

* Most expensive eye surgery -- Cornea transplants at $30,000+ to repair the clear, protective outer layer of the eye. This procedure is expensive because of the precision required to complete the surgery and because of the follow-up required. [MoneyInc](https://moneyinc.com/most-expensive-surgeries/)  

* Rarest eye color -- Green irises are the rarest (two percent of people), but there exist anecdotal reports that gray eyes are even rarer. [Kidadl](https://kidadl.com/articles/amazing-green-eyes-facts-how-much-do-you-know-about-the-rarest-eye-color)  

* Most expensive sunglasses -- in 2021, Chopard Sunglasses at $400,000. [Finance Online](https://financesonline.com/10-most-expensive-sunglasses-in-the-world-cartier-dolce-gabana-and-other-fancy-brands/)  

* Smallest object seen with a “light” microscope –- about 500 nanometers (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter), about 200 times smaller than the width of a hair. Bacteria, by the way, are about 1,000 nanometers in size. [Nanooze](https://www.nanooze.org/worlds-most-powerful-microcope/)  

* Farthest object seen with the unaided eye -- The Andromeda galaxy, a collection of a trillion stars 2.5 million light years distant. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/25/starwatch-the-furthest-thing-you-can-see-with-the-naked-eye)  

**Expressions**:  English has a multitude of figurative sayings related to eyesight.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes, see Work Additional Subthemes(  ).  For this collection of 164 idiomatic expressions, aside from identifying expressions myself, I drew on [ThoughtCo](https://www.thoughtco.com/eye-idioms-and-expressions-1209937) and [The Free Dictionary]( https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/eye).
