The four sections before this address subthemes of Beauty as [love from the first glance](https://bit.ly/3sB967G), the [wonders of nature](https://bit.ly/3dDvI3g), a [beautiful woman walking](https://bit.ly/3sB967G), and [instant appeal in a movie scene](https://bit.ly/3er5yzI).  Here we add a few more subthemes that don’t relate to any of the pieces of art.

**Evolution**:   Trust Mother Nature to have evolved humans to want to mate with the most attractive.  Eros is perhaps the most compelling drive of humanity – to procreate.  If attractiveness correlates with fertility and strength, the fittest survive and reproduce more.  Some women are drawn to men with power (Wilber Mills?), money (Aristotle Onassis?) or brains (Henry Kissinger, Jean-Paul Sartre?) more than classical good looks.  But in general, our sexual urges tend toward prime physical specimens.  

**Jealousy**:  Whoever dates or marries a very attractive person may suffer pangs of jealousy.  They imagine or see that others covet their beautiful man or woman and that can end badly.  The green-eyed monster gnaws at almost all couples somewhere in their relationship.  If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, never make a pretty woman your wife may be flippant, but it touches on an uncertainty about fidelity.

**Brains or Beauty**:  Sexists might believe that a woman cannot be both beautiful and intelligent.  Wrong.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, an intelligent woman, if she chooses to, may be more able to figure out how to look as attractive as possible given her physical attributes.  Physical qualities do not correlate to mental abilities.

**Expressions**:  We have many figurative sayings in English that pertain to Beauty.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes, along with my own knowledge, see [Work Additional Subthemes](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-02-26-workadditional/workperspective/).  Fifty of the idioms are below.
