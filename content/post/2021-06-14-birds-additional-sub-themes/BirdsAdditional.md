The preceding sections cover multiple aspects of Birds elicited from four works of art:   Claude Monet’s [The Magpie](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-07-birds-the-magpie-a-painting-by-claude-monet/birdsmagpie/) a [poem by John Keats, Ode to a Nightingale](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-14-birds-ode-to-a-nightingale-a-poem-by-john-keats/birdskeats/) a [rock song’s metaphor for a wanderlust male](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-07-birds-free-bird-a-song-by-lynyrd-skynyrd/birdsfreebird/) and a movie’s [terrifying strafings by vicious birds](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-07-birds-the-birds-a-movie-directed-by-alfred-hitchcock/birdsthebirds/). Here are additional thoughts about the theme of Birds that don’t associate closely with any of those works.

**Trained**: Birds can be taught, and have been put to a variety of uses.  People have trained birds to fly from point-to-point.  With that ability comes the possibility of timing them, thus racing one bird against another.   Other birds have been trained to fight, a cruel pastime that has been banned in the United States.  A cockfight splashes blood everywhere.  Still other birds once learned to carry small messages fit into containers tied to their feet and deliver them. Pigeons were even trained to direct bombs as they fell. Some species of birds can learn hundreds of words and repeat them. Finally, scary movies assembled trained birds.

**Food**: The flesh of domesticated birds feeds billions of people each year.  Whether the meal consists of fried chicken or chicken Cordon Bleu, the source is the same.  Or perhaps it is a turkey sandwich or turkey tetrazzini.  Chickens and turkeys by the billions are fattened for slaughter around the world.  Bird delicacies include pheasant under glass. It would not surprise me to find that cooks have published hundreds of fowl recipe books.  By the way, speaking of food, the word "guano" originates from the Andean indigenous language Quechua, which refers to any form of dung used as fertilizer.  Guano-producing species off the coast of Peru bird include the Peruvian pelican and the Peruvian booby.

**Extinct, Mythical or Cartoon**: Many birds exist no long, extinguished by climate, predators, or the actions of human beings.  The following losses are from a site that lists [ten birds hunted to extinction](https://www.thoughtco.com/recently-extinct-birds-1093727).

The Eskimo Curlew.  Migrating in a single, gigantic flock from Alaska and western Canada down to Argentina, via the western United States, and back again attracted too many hunters.  
The Carolina Parakeet.  
The Passenger Pigeon – once the most populous bird in the world.  
The Stephens Island Wren – wiped out by pet cats.  
The Great Auk.  
The Giant Moa -- a 12-foot, 600-pound bird.  
The Elephant Bird.  
The Dodo Bird.
The Eastern Moa.  
The Moa-Nalo.  

Scientists can list many moa extinct or severely threatened birds.

Birds appear in myths.  For example, the roc is an enormous legendary bird of prey in the popular mythology of the Middle East.  It appears in Arabic geographies and natural history, popularized in Arabian fairy tales and sailors' folklore.  The alkonost, the sirin, the caladrius, and the phoenix are four other mythical birds from legend and folklore.

Cartoons feature such classics as Big Bird, Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Road Runner, and Tweety Bird that have become icons in cartoons and annotated movies.   The list goes on, including Woody Woodpecker and Owl (in Winnie the Pooh). 

**Expressions**:  Nested in the English language are a covey of idioms that refer to birds.  Here are 39, many of which came from [bird idioms](https://www.thespruce.com/bird-idioms-explained-386739). Some of the sayings cast insults (the first three); others draw on physical analogies (the next group of five).  Then we have a group of four sayings that invoke the appearance of birds.  Many psychological observations (13 below) draw on avian characteristics.  Commonsense advice finds expression with birds.  And, then a flock of expressions (16) that roost everywhere.  The final group was added later.
