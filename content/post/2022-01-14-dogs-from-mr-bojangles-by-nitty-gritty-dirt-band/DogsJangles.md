Mr. Bojangles, a ballad by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, makes clear the continuing grief of an aging, alcoholic busker for his companion dog of 15 years.   Mr. Bojangles keeps on dancing, to scratch out a living, but his heart was still broken 20 years after that dog *up and died*.  I hope you apprreciate [the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyS4V1QMKJM).  Subthemes of the canine variety are associated with the song.

I knew a man, Bojangles and he danced for you  
In worn out shoes  
Silver hair, a ragged shirt and baggy pants  
The old soft shoe  
He jumped so high  
He jumped so high  
Then he'd lightly touch down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was  
Down and out  
He looked to me to be the eyes of age  
As he spoke right out  
He talked of life  
He talked of life  
He laughed, clicked his heels and stepped

He said his name, Bojangles and he danced a lick  
Across the cell  
He grabbed his pants, a better stance  
Oh, he jumped so high  
Then he clicked his heels  
He let go a laugh  
He let go a laugh  
Pushed back his clothes all around  
Mr. Bojangles  
Mr. Bojangles  
Mr. Bojangles  
Dance

He danced for those in minstrel shows and county fairs  
Throughout the south  
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and him  
Traveled about  
The dog up and died  
He up and died  
After twenty years he still grieves  
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks  
For drinks and tips  
But most the time I spend behind these county bars  
He said I drinks a bit  
He shook his head  
And as he shook his head  
I heard someone ask him please  
Please  
Mr. Bojangles  
Mr. Bojangles  
Mr. Bojangles  
Dance

**Service or Support**:  For 15 years, Mr. Bojangles unnamed dog was his best friend, counselor and “support dog” *avant la lettre*.  Eminently trainable and wanting to please their owners, dogs have been pressed into service to support human for all kinds of needs.  According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service dog is “a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability.”  Someone who is blind, for example, can walk about freely with the aid of their guide dog.  However, the training and matching process costs a lot, so it is thought that only about 2% of all people who are blind have a guide dog. [Guiding Eyes](https://www.guidingeyes.org/about/faqs/) says that there are approximately 10,000 guide dog teams currently in the United States.  Hearing dogs alert deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to important sounds.  Mobility dogs assist individuals who use wheelchairs, walking devices, or who have balance issues.  Medical alert dogs signal the onset of a seizure or low blood sugar, or the presence of allergens, and other warnings. Additionally, according to the [American Kennel Club](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/service-dog-training-101/), psychiatric service dogs assist individuals with disabilities such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, post–traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia.  

Emotional support dogs provide comfort just by being with a person. But, because these dogs are not trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability, they do not qualify as service dogs under the ADA.   Likewise, volunteer therapy dogs soothe and please people through opportunities for petting, affection, and play in retirement homes, college exam periods, and hospitals.  Pouring out all these forms of protection and affection, no wonder [people mourn](epitaph) the loss of their dog.

**Food**:  Sales of dog food in the United States totaled approximately \$7.7 billion in 2020, according to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/684855/value-pet-food-sales-value-us-by-category/).  Who knows what the additional cost is of all the scraps tossed to dogs or what they foraged for and snatched by themselves?  Conversely, although humans can digest dog food, the Food and Drug Administration does not recommend.  Feeding your dog and walking the dog are rituals of pet ownership.

Bojangles shared his food with his loyal companion and would never have considered eating him.  But in famines, starving people have eaten dogs, as the New York Times Book Review, Dec. 26, 2021, at 19 notes: during the Greek Revolution in the 1820’s “hungry townspeople [were] frying dogs in olive oil.”  But other parts of the world to this day consume dog meat.  [The BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-39577557) reported in 2017 that “an estimated 30 million dogs across Asia, including stolen family pets, are still killed for human consumption every year.”  While the practice is not widespread, it is most common in China, South Korea, The Philippines, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the region of Nagaland in India.

**Bites and Guards**:  The dog who accompanied Mr. Bojangles on his wanderings was probably [mild mannered](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-la-pont-de-l-europe-by-gustave-caillebotte/dogsbridge/), but also stood ready to protect his master.  No matter how cute they are, and no matter how much they become part of the family, dogs are still animals, and when provoked they can bite.  Each year, dogs in the United States bite more than 4.5 million people, and more than 800,000 of those bitten receive medical attention, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.  At least half of those bitten are children.  Worse yet, a [law firm](https://www.edgarsnyder.com/statistics/dog-bite-statistics.html) counted 39 dog bite-related fatalities in the U.S. in 2017.  Family dogs were responsible for 72 percent of all dog bite fatalities.  Beware of Dog, indeed!   Cynophobia is the term for an anxiety disorder based on overwhelming fear of dogs.  Dogs guarding properties and [prisoners](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-cool-hand-luke-a-movie-with-paul-newman/dogscool/) can unleash their animal instincts.  Their bite can be much worse than their bite.

&nbsp;

Years after his beloved dog died, Mr. Bojangles still pines and grieves.  He was closer to his buddy dog than to the people for whom he danced.  Animals that are pets, and service dogs particularly, become members of your family, eating and living with you, but every now and then biting.
