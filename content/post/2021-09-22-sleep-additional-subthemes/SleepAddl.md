The subthemes of Sleeping discussed above arise from a [movie about late-night romance](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-22-sleep-from-sleepless-in-seattle-a-movie-starring-tom-hanks-and-meg-ryan/sleepsleepless/), Yeats’ poetic vision of a [monster awakening](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-22-sleep-from-the-second-coming-a-poem-by-william-butler-yeats/sleepsecond/), a [lullaby for children in Africa](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-22-sleep-from-the-lion-sleeps-tonight-a-song-by-the-tokens/sleeplion/), and a [van Gogh](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-09-22-sleep-from-the-siesta-a-painting-by-vincent-van-gogh/sleepsiesta/) of reapers napping at mid-day.   We have a few more subthemes to present that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Research**:  Despite sleep consuming approximately one-third of all human time, much is not known about it and research into its causes, effects and characteristics continues steadily.  The [U.S. National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5181604) reports there are approximately 7,500 board-certified sleep specialists. 

Researchers have learned that your body cycles through four stages of sleep. The cycle occurs four to five times through the night for different lengths of time, varying from 70 to 120 minutes each.   The pattern includes non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, of which three stages are non-REM sleep and one stage is REM.  This summary comes from [HealthLine](https://www.healthline.com/health/why-do-we-sleep#what-happens-during-sleep).

**Records**:   Here is a sample of the longest, most expensive, and other superlatives associated with Sleep.  

Longest human sleep:  In October of 2017, Wyatt Shaw from Kentucky fell asleep for 11 days.  He was seven years old and doctors ran several tests with no conclusive explanations.  [Tuft and Needle](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/resources/whats-the-longest-someone-has-slept-tuft-needle/)

Longest period by a human without sleep:  For scientific research, seventeen-year-old Randy Gardner stayed awake for 11 straight days.  [Tuft and Needle](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/resources/whats-the-longest-someone-has-slept-tuft-needle/)

Loudest human snore:  In 1993, Swedish resident Kare Walkert set the record at 93 decibels. [Tuft and Needle](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/resources/whats-the-longest-someone-has-slept-tuft-needle/)

Best-selling energy drink in the world: Red Bull, manufactured by an Austrian company, sold 7.5 billion cans in 2019. [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull)

Most expensive bed:  The floating bed is regarded as visual art, with a price tag of $1.6 million.  Invented by a Dutch architect named Janjaap Ruijssenaars, the bed gives the impression of  floating, but it is actually suspended by a magnet system that hovers it approximately 16 inches off the ground.

**Expressions**:  Let’s rouse idiomatic sayings that refer to sleep in a figurative sense. The 71 below come from various sources and my own experience.  I exclude direct uses of the theme word, such as “It's time to sleep” as well as proverbs, such as “All are not asleep who have their eyes shut.” Online sources for the sayings listed alphabetically below include [The Free Dictionary](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/sleep), [Spell Zone](https://www.spellzone.com/blog/Twenty_Five_Idioms_about_Sleep.htm), and [English by Day](https://englishbyday.com/sleep-idioms/).
