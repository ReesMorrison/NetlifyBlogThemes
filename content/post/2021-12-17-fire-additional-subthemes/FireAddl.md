The subthemes of Fire discussed above came to mind from a [poem on aging and the embers of love](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-12-17-fire-from-when-you-are-old-a-poem-by-william-butler-yeats/fireold/), a painting with an [industrial smokestack](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-12-17-fire-from-the-flood-banks-of-the-seine-bougival-a-painting-by-alfred-sisley/fireflood/), a burning, passionate [plea for lovemaking](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-12-17-fire-from-light-my-fire-a-song-by-the-doors/firedoors/), and a movie about [a skyscraper ravaged by fire](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-12-17-fire-from-the-towering-inferno-a-film-with-paul-newman-steve-mcqueen-fred-astaire-and-faye-dunaway/firetowering/). Here are more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Mythology**:   Every ancient culture has its incarnation of fire.  Greek mythology had Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths, crafting, fire, and volcanoes; and Hestia, goddess of the hearth and its fires. Egyptian mythology had Ra, fire god of the sun, light, warmth, and growth. Hindus had Agni, the god of fire who also represents the essential energy of life in the universe.  In [Yoruba mythology](http://www.sacredhearthfrictionfire.com/fire-dieties.html), Ogun was the fire god and patron of blacksmiths, iron, warfare, and metal tools; Oya was the goddess of fire and wind; and Shango was the god of thunder and fire, considered the storm-god.  One more: Chinese mythology included Zao Shen, the Kitchen God, their goddess of fire.  And let’s not forget the phoenix, a mythical eagle-like creature known best for bursting into flame at the end of its life, only to emerge from the ashes as a young phoenix.  

**Records**:  We offer you a matchless set of superlatives related to Fire.

**Expressions**: Sometimes a heated topic, Fire has lit many related figurative sayings.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes on this blog, see Work Additional Subthemes.  For this collection of 65, aside from identifying expressions myself, I drew on [The Free Dictionary](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/fire) and [SpellZone](https://www.spellzone.com/blog/25_Idioms_about_Fire.htm).  Expressions do not include proverbs, such as “Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”
