The subthemes of Thinking discussed above came to mind from [Pope’s views on human cognition](raven), a painting of a [person  thinking](Aracharon), a claim in song that strong love coexists with [weak academics](wonderful), and a movie with [genius almost destroyed](beautiful). Here are more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Formal Logic**: An elaborate set of tools and notation enable logicians to state and analyze arguments in terms of their formal properties (regardless of content)  .  If P, then Q and so forth.  All computation, down to the silicon gates and registers, consists of extraordinarily rapid logical operations.  Modal logic contributes additional analytic tools such as “there may exist.”  Kurt Gödel even drew on on a very old argument to prove formally the existence of God.  As a form of abstract reasoning, in that respect like the outer reaches of higher math, the demands upon thinking are extreme.

**Records**:  We offer a clutch of superlatives for you to ponder related to Thinking.

**Expressions**:  The act of thinking or people who are adept at thinking (or challenged)   have spawned related figurative sayings.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes, see Work Additional Subthemes(  ).  For this collection of 68, aside from identifying expressions myself, I drew on [The Free Dictionary](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/thinking), [English Lesson Via Skype](https://www.englishlessonviaskype.com/10-idioms-about-thinking-and-learning/), [SpellZone](https://www.spellzone.com/blog/25_idioms_about_thought_and_memory.htm), and [7 ESL](https://7esl.com/idioms-about-thinking-and-learning/).
