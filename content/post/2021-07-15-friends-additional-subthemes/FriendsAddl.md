The preceding sections cover multiple aspects of Friends elicited from four works of art:   Édouard Manet’s [Luncheon on the Grass](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-luncheon-on-the-grass-a-painting-by-edouard-manet/friendsluncheon/), a [poem by Maya Angelou, Alone](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-alone-a-poem-by-maya-angelou/friendsalone/), James Taylor's [ballad about full-bore friendship](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-you-ve-got-a-friend-a-song-by-carol-king-sung-by-james-taylor/friendstaylor/), and a [movie reunion of young adults](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-the-big-chill-a-movied-directed-by-lawrence-kasdan/friendschill/). Here are additional thoughts about the theme of Friends that don’t associate closely with any of those works.

**Common Values and Interests**: Bruce Springsteen’s “Bobby Jean” makes the point that mutual interests cable good friends together.

“Now you hung with me when all the others turned away turned up their nose  
We liked the same music we liked the same bands we liked the same clothes”    

Like Bobby Jean and her admirer, friends root for the same team, delight in similar foods, are active in a particular church, go to bingo games and movies, binge watch that series on TV, hike trails they both like, run in the same social circles.  They are simpatico.

**Best Friends Forever**:  The phrase “Best Friends Forever” (BFF) arises most commonly among adolescent girls.  Two of them bond tightly and each swears that the other is her soulmate until the end of time, the extra-special girl who knows them best and can be trusted most, their mutual rocks in the tumultuous hormonal years.   In the genre of the teenage crush, or so-called “puppy love”, BFFs blaze as a fervent infatuation, while they last.  With “friends at first sight,” as when Forrest Gump sits on the school bus seat next to Jenny, magic happens.  

**Psychology and Sociology**: Psychologists, therapists, anthropologists, and sociologists have for years mined friendship from academic and research perspectives.  They smelted what they dug out into theories that conceptualize the phenomenon.  They cite instances of conformity and deviance and debate the cultural, social, and personal forces at work.  They coin terms that enter popular discourse: narcissism, fundamental attribution error, triadic closure, emotional contagion.  We’ll close this scant nod to the professors with the definition of “friendship” from the American Psychological Association: “a voluntary relationship between two or more people that is relatively long-lasting and in which those involved tend to be concerned with meeting the others’ needs and interests as well as satisfying their own desires. Friendships frequently develop through shared experiences in which the people involved learn that their association with one another is mutually gratifying.”  Precise, but hardly makes the heart beat faster.

**Expressions**: The 17 idiomatic sayings presented alphabetically below refer to friends in a figurative sense. I exclude direct uses of the theme word and proverbs. The idiomatic expressions come from my own knowledge of English and various online sources:
