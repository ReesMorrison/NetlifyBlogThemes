In one of her happiest poems and most extended metaphors, Emily Dickinson imagines “The Railway Train” as a mighty steed, prancing powerfully across the land, yet well-trained (so to speak) when evening falls.  Readers can spot several subthemes of Trains animated by this creative poem.

“The Railway Train,” by Emily Dickinson
 
I like to see it lap the miles,  
And lick the valleys up,  
And stop to feed itself at tanks;  
And then, prodigious, step   
Around a pile of mountains,  
And, supercilious, peer  
In shanties, by the sides of roads;  
And then a quarry pare   
To fit its sides, and crawl between,  
Complaining all the while  
In horrid, hooting stanza;  
Then chase itself down hill   
And neigh like Boanerges;  
Then, punctual as a star,  
Stop--docile and omnipotent--  
At its own stable door.   

**Formidable Power**:   Trains in the 19th century embodied power; Dickinson chose the word *prodigious*.  They loomed above people, bellowed sound, poured out smoke, created a rush of wind, and hauled unimaginable weight.   For hours a train could pull not only a string of [passenger carriages](Orient) but also tons of lumber, coal, grains, and other freight.   Trains pass loudly, or as Dickinson put it *neigh like Boanerges*, referring to Jesus’ nickname for a disciple who preached loudly.  The full-throated roar of a train blustering by reminded the poet of that stentorian voice.  To this day, the blur and commotion of an Amtrak train plummeting by calls out its visceral power and dynamism.  Or the stolid parade of a 100-car freight train in the Midwest signals a beast with momentum almost too much to stop – one that is *omnipotent*.  In the poem, the train stallion is easily able to 

*step*   
*Around a pile of mountains*  

Trains have been proud giants (*supercilious*) that surpassed all else on land with their broad shoulders of speedy steel.

**Speed**:  Given long stretches of track with no stations, trains can build up speed.  Not so much commuter trains, which slow and stop at each station, but [long-distance trains](Orleans) can *lap the miles* at above 50 miles an hour.  In Dickinson’s imagination, trains could *lick the valleys up*, lickety-split.  Today, according to [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail), the Shanghai Maglev Train, opened in 2004, is the fastest magnetic levitation train in operation, at 258 mph (430 km/h). The Euroduplex TGV trains broke a record of 344 mph (574.8 km/h), making it the fastest conventional wheeled train.  In their glory days, before automobiles appeared, trains were by far the fastest form of transit on land.  
With that speed and weight, however, trains take a long time to slow and [come to rest](Lazare).  

*Stop--docile and omnipotent--*  
*At its own stable door.*  

Trains build up tremendous kinetic energy as anyone notices when an Acela roars by.

**Metaphor of Restrictive Rails**:  Even with all its muscular force, however, a train must stay on its allotted tracks and switch only when directed by workers.  Dickinson chooses to convey this constraint wit the word *docile*, which conveys the surprising obedience of the powerful genie train despite its imposing physique when it is let out.  In comparison to other forms of transportation, trains must stick within a narrow gauge, so to speak.  Horses can move any way and any where, cars enjoy somewhat more freedom of movement (especially if we take into account off-roading), planes can change altitude but are locked into landing at or taking off from airports, ships freely roam the seas.

Trains cannot climb much, so construction workers must carve mountains (or build tunnels) so that the beast can ascend:

*And then a quarry pare*  
*To fit its sides, and crawl between,*  

because a train could not climb more than a slight upward grade.  Brawny trains and canal boats have to follow the strait and narrow, and the flat.

Remarkable when Dickinson wrote, and even to this day, trains embody a powerful force harnessed to the needs of humans.  They can outhaul anything and outrun most, yet they must obey the strictures of the level tracks on which they gallop.
