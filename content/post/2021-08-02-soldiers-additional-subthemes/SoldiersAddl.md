The preceding four sections have considered a [poem regretting a doomed cavalry charge](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-02-soldiers-from-the-charge-of-the-light-brigade-by-alfred-lord-tennyson/soldierscharge/), a [song of a young soldier lost](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-02-soldiers-from-travellin-soldier-a-song-by-the-chicks/soldierschicks/), a [movie with Private Forrest Gump](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-02-soldiers-from-forrest-gump-a-movie-starring-tom-hanks/soldiersgump/), and a painting of soldiers [executing traitors](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-02-soldiers-the-execution-of-maximilian-a-painting-by-edouard-manet/soldiersmanet/).  Here are a few other subthemes of Soldiers.

**Military Bases**: Soldiers must train somewhere, standing armies must be station their forces when they are not deployed, and supplies must be stored.  To do so, countries used to build forts but now build military bases.  the United States maintains nearly 800 of them in more than 70 countries and territories—from giant “Little Americas” to small radar facilities. [Politico] (https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/us-military-bases-around-the-world-119321/)   reported these numbers in 2015 and added that the proliferation of military bases costs more than $200 billion a year.  An enlistee or draftee’s first impression of the military is probably a base, and their final impression (alive and mustering out or in a casket)   is likely to be a military base.  On a personal note, I was born at Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri, and attended school for five years on bases in Mannheim, Germany and Seoul, Korea.  

**Service Lines**: The military forces of nations have often created separate service lines for their land, sea and air soldiers.   The United States has organized six branches: the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard as well as the new Space Force.  Four of them have an academy for officers, all of them cherish their strong traditions, and several of them brandish rock-ribbed rivalries.  The Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)   is a college program offered at more than 1,700 colleges and universities across the United States that prepares young adults to become officers in the U.S. Military.  In exchange for a paid college education, ROTC cadets commit to serve in the military after graduation.  All the branches roll out recruitment efforts that vary by what they have to offer and the kinds of enlistees they seek.   

**Elite Units**:  Each branch boasts of its studs, whether they be the SEALS, US Army Special Forces (the Green Berets)  , The Blue Angels, or several others.  Here is a list of the [top ten honored units.](https://special-ops.org/the-most-elite-military-units-in-the-united-states/)    Servicemen compete strenuously to be invited to join an elite unit, as only the toughest and most capable endure the winnowing out rigors.  Once in a group, they keep up their training and are ready to take on the most difficult and dangerous missions.

**Expressions**: The 102 idiomatic sayings presented alphabetically below refer to soldiers in a
figurative sense. I exclude direct uses of the theme word and proverbs. The idiomatic expressions come from my own knowledge of English and various online sources:
