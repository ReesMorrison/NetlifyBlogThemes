Previous posts have spent time on four works of art that suggests characteristics of time:  a [poem of concern about wasting time on wooing](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-to-his-coy-mistress-by-andrew-marvell/timecoy/), a [painting of a family with a prominent, symbolic clock](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-from-the-bellili-family-by-edgar-degas/timebellili/), a ‘60’s [song about choices of moments and milestones](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-from-turn-turn-turn-by-the-byrds/timeturnturn/), and a movie based on [variations from the same starting point](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-08-time-from-groundhog-day-starring-bill-murray/timegroundhog/). Each post draws out subthemes of time, but a few subthemes pertain to more than one piece of art or none of them.

**Space-Time Continuum **:  Physicists have studied time for, well, a long time.  Ever since the breakthroughs of Albert Einstein, we understand the melding of space and time, as physical constructs, into a mathematical/physical entity called 'space-time'.   Because space consists of three dimensions, and time is one-dimensional, space-time must, therefore, have four dimensions. It is deemed a 'continuum' because as far as we know, there are no missing points in space or instants in time, and both can be subdivided without any apparent limit in size or duration.[Here is the Stanford University  explanation the preceding was drawn from.](https://einstein.stanford.edu/content/relativity/q411.html)

**Time Shrinks with Velocity**:   Einstein's theory of special relativity says that time slows down or speeds up depending on how fast you move relative to something else.  Approaching the speed of light, a person inside a spaceship would age much slower than her twin at home.  The passage of time for a speedy traveler will slow down relative to the elapsed time on Earth.   Even astronauts who orbit the earth at speeds a tiny fraction of the 670 million miles per hour light zips along return to earth fractions of a second younger than the mission controllers in Houston.
