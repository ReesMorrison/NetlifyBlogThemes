“The Winner Takes It All” by ABBA

I don't wanna talk  
About things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  

I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  

The winner takes it all  
The loser's standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's her destiny  

I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  

Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  

The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  

The winner takes it all (Takes it all)  
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)  
It's simple and it's plain (It's so plain)  
Why should I complain (Why complain)  

But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed   

The judges will decide (Will decide)  
The likes of me abide (Me abide)  
Spectators of the show (Of the show)  
Always staying low (Staying low)  

The game is on again (On again)  
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)  
A big thing or a small (Big or small)  
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)  

I don't wanna talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  

I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  

But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all  
So the winner takes it all  

And the loser has to fall  
Throw the dice, cold as ice  
Way down here, someone dear  
Takes it all, has to fall  
And it's plain, I complain

The sadness, loss and resignation a shattering divorce triggers makes “The Winner Takes It All” heartrending.   The marital collapse eroded over time, perhaps, or erupted suddenly, but the dice thrown by impersonal forces landed the wrong way and the life of a wife came asunder.  Chance shows up throughout this [Abba hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92cwKCU8Z5c).

**Bad Things Happen**:  Often for deeply complex or inexplicable reasons, disasters, death, failure and divorce strike.  Why the tragedy descends may  be due to the confluence of coincidence and randomness.  The tree fell just as the car passed, the lungs couldn’t expel the asbestos slivers, the dam gave way after 65 years, the [enemy captured the soldiers](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-14-chancedeerhunter/chancedeer/) or the physical abuse worsened abruptly.  

*The gods may throw a dice*  
*Their minds as cold as ice*  
*And someone way down here*  
*Loses someone dear*  

To the grieving survivors, implacable monsters picked the short straw for them, so the pain from the lost Malaysian jetliner, the bomb at the Boston Marathon, or the virus costs *someone dear*.  Chance bares its fangs as impersonal forces such as [economics and race](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-18-destruction-from-my-hometown-a-rock-ballad-by-bruce-springsteen/destructhometown/), a [sadistic guard at a concentration camp](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-08-decisions-sophie-s-choice-with-meryl-streep/decisionssophies/), or perhaps family history for star-crossed lovers.

**Unknown Future**:  Any time we invoke the term “chance” we are referring to the future, and the future cannot be predicted with certainty.   We may have heard that many marriages end with divorce, but when the wedding bells ring, that is a future neither the bride nor the groom anticipate or even want to think about – that’s an unknowable, possible future chance but far from the one they dream about:

*I figured it made sense*  
*Building me a fence*

The singer believed she had arranged her life, but the concatenation of events big and small that snuffed out the marriage was chance upending her.  At times she might have prayed or [sought guidance from a minister](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-14-chancechurch/chancechurch/) but the unknowable future prevailed.  Chance was decreed as certainty.


**Physical or Person**:  The lyrics of this song speak to the lightning bolt of traumatic divorce loosed by a spouse.  The husband insisted on divorce and shattered not only a marriage but a life dream.  We read about the drunken driver smashing another car or a kid playing with a loaded gun, both of which we might consider a person-instigated chance.  By contrast, an avalanche triggers without a human being anywhere near or a roof gives way when too much snow accumulates, and neither has anything to do with a person.  Nature’s random forces that display a rainbow or hive off the glacier are impersonal.  They flash [*Crass Casualty*](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-03-14-chancehap/chancehap/).  At least if the chance meeting at a bar leads somewhere, you can believe clues and signals were available  -- chance events that involve a person feel less inscrutable than Nature’s surprises.

Forces and decisions beyond the control of the singer upended her happy life.  She can’t figure out what happened to her marriage, so it feels like cruel gods randomly dealt her a divorce card.  The opposite of serendipity, the hurt from this song follows the sharp pangs of destructive chance.
