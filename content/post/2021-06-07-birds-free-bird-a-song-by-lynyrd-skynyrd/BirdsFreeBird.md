A young man explains his leaving a girlfriend, and exults in his choice, by invoking the image of a bird unfettered to come and go as it pleases.  He can’t help himself, he suggests, and he can’t change his behavior because, like a bird, he is destined to flit off to other places, other experiences, other women.  What else does this song suggest about Birds?

"Free Bird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd

If I leave here tomorrow  
Would you still remember me?  
For I must be traveling on now  
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see  

But if I stay here with you, girl  
Things just couldn't be the same  
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird, you cannot change  
Lord knows, I can't change  

Bye-bye, baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah  
Though this feelin' I can't change  
Please don't take it so badly  
'Cause Lord knows, I'm to blame  

If I stay here with you, girl  
Things just couldn't be the same  
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now  
And this bird you cannot change  
Oh, oh, oh, oh   
And the bird you cannot change  
And this bird, you cannot change  

Lord knows, I can't change  
Lord help me, I can't change  
Lord, I can't change  
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah  

[Here is an 11-minute performance of Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyd way back in 1977 at the Oakland Coliseum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxIWDmmqZzY).

**Roaming Freely**: Birds fly anytime, anywhere, and any distance for as long as they have energy.  In their natural habitat the flits and flights of birds are completely unfettered: “free as a bird” goes the saying.  Like the singer, they move on whenever they choose *’Cause I’m as free as a bird as a bird now*.  Unlike a plane, car or [train](subtheme of Trains), no roads, railway tracks, or airports restrict where they start and end or how they travel.  Because birds can fly, they are symbols of freedom with their ability to quickly and easily escape from troubles, dangers, or complications.  This boy leaves his girlfriend even though he *knows, I’m to blame*.

**Sudden, Darting, Frightened**:  We can’t tell from the song why the boy decides to be [alone](Monet), that he must fly away.  We can’t spot why a tree full of birds scatter, but often a sound sets them off.  Like many animals, they are skittish and afraid; the boy perhaps fears “being trapped” or led unwillingly to the altar or that the emotions and attraction*just wouldn’t be the same*.  Take fright, take flight.  Or perhaps he was upset and depressed, but no [nightingale cheered him](Keats).

**Pets**:  It’s interpreting this song speculatively to wonder if the girl was an ornament, a short-term and casual fling with a plaything pet.  Many bird lovers keep a canary, a [pair of lovebirds](Hitchcock) or other songbird as a pet.  They require little maintenance, other than cleaning the cage from time to time, and they display distinctive personalities.  You can train birds and even let them fly around the house at will.  An ugly side of the popularity of birds, bird traffickers brutally capture the helpless creatures, killing many of them or ruining their habitats, imprison them in dreadful conditions, and sell them.

A rock song heavier on music and live performance than on the quality of its lyrics, "Free Bird"" epitomizes the footloose, callous unwillingness of a boy to settle down.  He abandons the girl he’s been seeing, without introspection and with the excuse of being free as a bird.
