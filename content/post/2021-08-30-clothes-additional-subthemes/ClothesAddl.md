The penumbral subthemes of Clothes discussed above arise from four works of art: a [movie culminating with a stunningly dressed Audrey Hepburn](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-30-clothes-from-my-fair-lady-a-movie-starring-audrey-hepburn/clothesfair/), a [Robert Herrick poem about silken sheen](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-30-clothes-from-upon-julia-s-clothes-a-poem-by-robert-herrick/clothesjulia/), a Rolling Stones rebuke of [expensive clothes](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-30-clothes-from-play-with-fire-a-song-by-the-rolling-stones/clothesfire/), and a painting of variously-clad [bathers and sunbathers](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-08-30-clothes-from-bathers-at-asnieres-a-painting-by-georges-seurat/clothesbathers/).  We have a few more subthemes to present.

**Personality**:  For most people, their overall personality matches the clothes they choose to wear.  Extroverts, egotists, and exhibitionists preen about in showy or exaggerated garb; quiet folk stick to a plainer, more ordinary look.  Artsy folk use jewelry, piercings, and clothes style to express their aesthetic orientation; pragmatic philistines slap on whatever lasts for a long time and doesn’t require ironing.  Some “clothes horses” accumulate racks of shoes or purses if they suffer from oniomania (compulsive shopping).  What we wear signals our place in the world: clique or gang, goth or preppie, young professional or bohemian, metrosexual or farmer, academic or athlete – the gamut of humanity.  We are what we wear.

**Records**:  As with everything human, we can present the most, the biggest, the oldest and other records associated with Clothes.  We have already ogled the most expensive dress. 

•	Oldest woven garment -- Called the Tarkhan Dress, it probably fell past the knees originally. At 5,100 to 5,500 years old, it dates to the dawn of the kingdom of Egypt. [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/160218-oldest-dress-egypt-tarkhan-archaeology)

•	Most expensive fabric -- Vicuña Wool is the most expensive wool in the world.  It comes from Peru’s Vicuña sheep in the Central Andes, which can only be shorn once every three years.

**Expressions**:  People speaking with each other rely on clothes references in a figurative sense.  Here are 63 idiomatic sayings that refer to an item of clothing but apply more broadly.  They come from various sources and my own experience.
