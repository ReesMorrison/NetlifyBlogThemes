The penumbral subthemes of Clothes discussed above arise from four works of art: a [movie culminating with a stunningly dressed Audrey Hepburn](Fair), a [Herrick poem about silken sheen](Ode), a Rolling Stones rebuke of [expensive clothes](Fire), and a painting of variously-clad [bathers and sunbathers](Seurat).  We have a few more subthemes to present.

**Personality**:  For most people, their overall personality matches the clothes they choose to wear.  Extroverts, egotists, and exhibitionists preen about in showy or exaggerated garb; quiet folk stick to a plainer, more ordinary look.  Artsy folk use jewelry, piercings, and clothes style to express their aesthetic orientation; pragmatic philistines slap on whatever lasts for a long time and doesn’t require ironing.  Some “clothes horses” accumulate racks of shoes or purses if they suffer from oniomania (compulsive shopping).  What we wear signals our place in the world: clique or gang, goth or preppie, young professional or bohemian, metrosexual or farmer, academic or athlete – the gamut of humanity.  We are what we wear.

**Records**:  As with everything human, we can present the most, the biggest, the oldest and other records associated with Clothes.  We have already ogled the most expensive dress.
