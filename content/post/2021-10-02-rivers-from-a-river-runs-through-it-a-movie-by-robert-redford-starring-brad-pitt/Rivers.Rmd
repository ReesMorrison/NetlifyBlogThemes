# Rivers

## "A River Runs Through It," a movie by Robert Redford starring Brad Pitt

*A River Runs Through It*, directed by Robert Redford and starring Brad Pitt, gifts us with scenes of  pristine Montana rivers in Edenic grandeur.  Beautiful vistas abound of fly fishing by the rocks and eddies of inviting waters.  Here is a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsIolBViUmc) to remind you of the movie.  And, here are subthemes of Rivers we reeled in.


**Boundaries**:  No river delineates a side of Montana, but the Mississippi River borders parts of ten states: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  The Hudson River separates New Jersey from New York and the Delaware River does so for New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  We learn this from [Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147242/how-rivers-shape-states), which also notes that rivers frequently mark the boundary between countries, such as the Rio Grande between the United States and Mexico, the Niagara River between Canada and the United States, and the Jordan River between Israel and Jordan.  The Yalu River separates North Korea from China.  The same online site states that “rivers make up 23 percent of international borders, 17 percent of the world’s state and provincial borders, and 12 percent of all county-level local borders.” And, let's not forget, Caesar crossed the Rubicon and precipitated a civil war.

Treaties used to allocate territories according to the locations of rivers.  For example, after the Revolutionary War, the Treaty of Paris extended U.S. territory to the Mississippi River; the Louisiana Purchase was demarcated by the Mississippi River on the east.   In short, maps often indicate not only political lines but also the paths of rivers.

**Potable Water** In the New World, immigrants from Europe trickled westward.  Typically, they settled around lakes and rivers because those sources provided water for drinking, washing, irrigating, milling, and shipping.  Clean, plentiful, drinkable water ranked highest in appeal.  Sources of potable water were magnets for the establishment of hamlets and towns, not to mention a [*stately pleasure-dome*](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-kubla-khan-a-poem-by-samuel-taylor-coleridge/riverskhan/).  It may be that no confluence of major rivers in America lacks a city, such as is the case with Pittsburgh’s Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers or St. Paul embracing the Mississippi, Minnesota and Crow.  Reservoirs of drinking water, including the largest in the United States, Lake Mead, are typically fed by one or more rivers and spill out into one of those rivers. Aqueducts are man-made mini-rivers to channel water. 

**Pollution**:   The scenes in the movie feature spectacularly fresh water.  But such cleanness can be found in fewer and fewer rivers.  According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/water-pollution-everything-you-need-know), nearly half of our rivers and streams are polluted and unfit for swimming, fishing, and drinking. Nutrient pollution, which includes nitrates and phosphates, is the leading contamination in rivers due to farm waste and fertilizer runoff.  Municipal and industrial waste is discharged as toxins.  In the past, a major river such as the [Seine](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-03-rivers-from-the-seine-and-the-louvre-a-painting-by-camille-pissarro/riversseine/) might carry off the effluents, but now our population densities, waste removal policies, and factories have overwhelmed rivers.  On the whole, because of the tragedy of the commons and capitalist disregard for externalities, we make poor decisions regarding how to protect our natural resources.  

True, a filthy river can be resuscitated, but that takes years of work, gobs of money, and unusual political will power.  Seoul, Korea’s, Cheonggyecheon Stream Restoration Project runs for 3.6 miles in the heart of the capital.  According to the [Landscape Performance Series](https://www.landscapeperformance.org/case-study-briefs/cheonggyecheon-stream-restoration), among the many benefits of the restoration, it “increased overall biodiversity by 639% between the pre-restoration work in 2003 and the end of 2008 with the number of plant species increasing from 62 to 308, fish species from 4 to 25, bird species from 6 to 36, aquatic invertebrate species from 5 to 53, insect species from 15 to 192, mammals from 2 to 4, and amphibians from 4 to 8.”  Humans are hardly the only form of life that depend on rivers.

**Drying Up**:  Enjoying the aquatic abundance of the Redford film, you wouldn’t imagine that rivers might disappear.  Yet, for many reasons, rivers can reduce to rivulets or less.  Mostly, this is a seasonal shrinkage as snowmelt or other causes reduce water flow.  In droughts, only the cracked riverbed reminds us of what we have lost.  In recent years, may rivers have gone extinct.  Shifting patterns of precipitation can strangle the heads of rivers; upstream dams pool too much water behind them; hotter temperatures evaporate water as it travels downstream; farmers and industry suck irrigation waters too thirstily.   In China alone, out of 50,000 rivers, 28,000 have completely dried up in the last 20 years according to [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/6-major-rivers-facing-drought-like-situations-from-overuse).  When rivers disappear, lakes and reservoirs are threatened.


As a metaphor for an idyllic childhood and [home](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-ferry-cross-the-mersey-a-song-by-gerry-the-pacemakers/riversferry/), the sparkling, mouthwatering rivers filmed by Robert Redford evoke summer perfection.  They also symbolize boundaries between childhood and manhood, or between fathers and sons.  We see no signs of dirty water or risk of disappearance as the fishing paradise flows lushly.

## "The Seine and the Louvre," a painting by Camille Pissarro

Camille Pissarro painted the Seine River in Paris as it languidly passed before the Louvre.  We see levees, barges, bridges, and piers among the accessories of that famous river.  Several aspects of Rivers as a theme emerges from this impressionist work of art.

![Seine and Louvre by Pissaro](/media/RiversSeine.jpg) from [StaticFlickr](https://live.staticflickr.com/1951/44870948761_f05d18e908_b.jpg).

**Transportation**:  Before railroad trains crisscrossed the land, bulk materials traveled long distances mostly by canal or river barge.  Floating hods of coal, timber, and other heavy loads wended their way along the Mississippi, the Ohio, the Susquehanna, and many other arteries.  Where lakes formed from rivers, they supplemented the trans-shipment network.   As towns sprouted along the banks of rivers,  ships docked as they passed back and forth to ports and were loaded onto or from the waiting ocean-crossing ships.  For example, the Willamette River in Oregon supports Portland and a string of cities on its way to the Pacific.  Passengers and commerce travelled on [ferries](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-ferry-cross-the-mersey-a-song-by-gerry-the-pacemakers/riversferry/) or riverboats.  Particularly in the 19th century river-borne cargo dominated, but even in recent years “Domestic waterborne shipping in the United States move[d] 14% of the national cargo tonnage … [and] provide[d] an 
estimated 124,000 direct jobs.” [Homeland Security Digital Library](https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=484366)

**Floods**: The stone embankments that can be seen on either side of the Seine help contain the river if heavy rains raise it.   River-dwellers build dikes and runoff areas, they planted vegetation and redirected storm sewers, they stacked sandbags and built on stilts, but if the heavens open, a river can still drown land and destroy buildings.  In the developed world, wide rivers now flow more docilely as they are tamed by these precautions as well as by dams and floodplains designed to alleviate excessive buildup of water. During an inundation, drownings happen.   Between 500,000 and 800,000 people perished in China’s 1938 Yellow River catastrophe.  In the days after, flood waters may spread dreadful diseases such as cholera and dysentery.  Outdoor sanitation facilities share their diseases through the receding water, and whoever drinks that water may sicken unto death.

**Entertainment and Sports**:  Rivers enable many kinds of pleasures.  As can be seen in the lower left of Pissarro’s painting, people enjoy walking beside rivers and watching both the bustle, drama, and placidity.  Many cities have created esplanades and parks alongside their rivers.   Restaurants and bars alcohol perch next to rivers, such as the River Café in Brooklyn, so that patrons in fancy clothes can dine and dance against the backdrop of river.  A range of sports can take place on a river, such as jet skiing, waterskiing, triathloning, and [fishing](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-a-river-runs-through-it-a-movie-by-robert-redford-starring-brad-pitt/riversruns/).  Other people choose to kayak and canoe or simply to sunbathe by them. If the river stretches broad enough, and wind comes, sailors love it. In addition, rivers give pleasure when Macy’s launches fireworks on the Hudson or ballparks nestle next to rivers, as in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati.


This calm and somber painting features the Seine River flowing through the heart of Paris.  The viewer can pick out many characteristics of a river: a vital artery of transport, a tame creature that can still rise up with destruction, and forms of pleasure it sustains.  

## "Kubla Khan," a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge

Supposedly while under the influence of laudanum, Samuel Taylor Coleridge dreamed about a lengthy, but upon recovering could only recall the 54 lines of his famous poem, *Kubla Khan*.  It begins with a river, a river invested with portentous power and divine significance.  We can draw out various sub-themes of River.


In Xanadu did Kubla Khan  
A stately pleasure-dome decree:  
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran  
Through caverns measureless to man  
   Down to a sunless sea.  
So twice five miles of fertile ground  
With walls and towers were girdled round;  
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,  
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;  
And here were forests ancient as the hills,  
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.

But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted  
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!  
A savage place! as holy and enchanted  
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted  
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!  
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,  
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,  
A mighty fountain momently was forced:  
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst  
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,  
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:   
And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever  
It flung up momently the sacred river.  
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion  
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,  
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far  
Ancestral voices prophesying war!  
   The shadow of the dome of pleasure  
   Floated midway on the waves;  
   Where was heard the mingled measure  
   From the fountain and the caves.  
It was a miracle of rare device,  
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

 A damsel with a dulcimer  
   In a vision once I saw:  
   It was an Abyssinian maid  
It was an Abyssinian maid  
   And on her dulcimer she played,  
   Singing of Mount Abora.  
   Could I revive within me  
   Her symphony and song,  
   To such a deep delight ’twould win me,  
That with music loud and long,  
I would build that dome in air,  
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!  
And all who heard should see them there,  
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!  
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!  
Weave a circle round him thrice,  
And close your eyes with holy dread  
For he on honey-dew hath fed,  
And drunk the milk of Paradise.


**Mythology and Religion**:   Throughout the poem, the *sacred river* Alph mysteriously pours along, a blur of truth and myth.  Perhaps the best-known example of a river in mythology is the Styx where Charon [ferried](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-ferry-cross-the-mersey-a-song-by-gerry-the-pacemakers/riversferry/) the dead from Earth (Gaia) to the Underworld (Hades).  The mother of Achilles dipped him in it to render him invulnerable, except where she held him.   Geographically, the Underworld was believed to be surrounded by five rivers: the Acheron (river of woe), the Cocytus (river of lamentation), the Phlegethon (river of fire), the Styx, and the Lethe (river of forgetfulness).  Not only were rivers worshiped, but the Greeks recognized river gods, the Potamoi.  Thus, if you combine hippo meaning horse (as in (hippodrome, hippocampus) and potamus (as in the river gods) you get hippopotamus.

Further East, the Ganges River is sacred to Hindus.  It is believed to personify the Goddess Ganga. Hindu belief holds that bathing in the Ganges on certain occasions causes the forgiveness of transgressions and helps attain salvation.  One stretch of the Ganges and the holy places that line it is shown below.

![Ganges River](/media/RiversGanges.jpg)

**Government Regulation**:  Kublai was the fifth khagan-emperor of the Mongol Empire, reigning from 1260 to 1294.  Coleridge imagined a variant of his name for them poem.  The Kubla Khan of poetic fame was a government of one, and he oversaw the mighty river’s course. 

Likewise, other governments regulate riverways.  So crucial are they, for irrigation and for power among other benefits, that cities specify embankments and other construction, as in [Paris](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-03-rivers-from-the-seine-and-the-louvre-a-painting-by-camille-pissarro/riversseine/) or ferries in Liverpool. National governments regulate to widely varying degrees how those invaluable resources should be managed.  They do not leave it to chance or local governments. For example, the Colorado River is overseen by the Upper Colorado River Authority and the Lower Colorado River Authority. New York and New Jersey coordinate regarding the Hudson River through the Port Authority. At the international level, countries have struggled to agree to equitable arrangements for exploiting and protecting rivers.  The Zambezi River Authority is a corporation jointly and equally owned by the governments of Zambia and Zimbabwe.  As the world heats and dries, conflict over water to drink and water to drive turbines will become worsen.

**Battles**:  Fortifications bestrode rivers, such as St. Angelo in Rome or the walls girdling Kubla Khan’s city. As long as we are on military leaders, we should note history-changing battles around rivers. According to [World History](https://www.worldhistory.org/Battle_of_Issus/), the Battle of Issus, on Nov. 5, 333 BCE, was Alexander the Great's first direct engagement with King Darius III, in southern modern-day Turkey across the River Penarus.  It was a major victory for Alexander, defeating the Achaemenid Empire and causing Darius III to flee the battlefield.  A millennium later, the Battle of the Vorskla River looms large in the medieval history of Eastern Europe.  It was fought on August 12, 1399, between the Tatars and the armies of Tokhtamysh and Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania. The battle ended in a decisive Tatar victory.  Washington and his soldiers famously crossed the Delaware River to attack the Hessian soldiers of Trenton on Christmas Day.   One hundred fifty years later, during World War I, the bloody battles of the Somme and the Marne took their name from the nearby river.  Part of what protected Stalingrad in World War II from the invading Germans was the mighty Volga River.  

**Hydroelectric Power**:  Rushing, gushing water such as the *sacred river* Alph has muscles!  Starting with the very earliest waterwheels, people harnessed the strength of river water.  The water mill, for example, is said to have originated in the 3rd century BCE in the Greek province of Byzantium.   Designs improved over time so that flowing water spun a large waterwheel.  A shaft connected to the wheel axle transmitted the power from the water through a system of gears and cogs to machinery, such as a millstone to grind grains or corn.

Water wheels were obsoleted by electric power.  Hoover Dam, with its massive electricity production powered by the flow of water out of Lake Mead, stands tall in that regard.  In 2020, total U.S. conventional hydroelectricity generation was about 291 billion kilowatt-hours, equal to about 7.3% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation.  Both China and Brazil produce more hydroelectricity than the U.S.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dams_and_reservoirs_in_the_United_States) and
[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/dam-removals/) inform us that the United States has more than three million miles of rivers and streams, and on them are approximately 84,000 dams, of which 8,100 are classified as “major dams.”  Only a portion of those dams convert river flow to electricity.


The fantastical *Kubla Khan* begins with a mighty, revered river running through the city of the Mongol leader.  The opposite of a tranquil [fishing stream](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-a-river-runs-through-it-a-movie-by-robert-redford-starring-brad-pitt/riversruns/), its wild robustness resembles the awesome Khan’s military prowess.


## "Ferry Cross the Mersey," a song by Gerry & the Pacemakers

In 1965, a British band released a song with a name and lyrics referring to the river that flows through Liverpool, the Mersey, and a ferry service that crosses it.  The song simply and powerfully speaks of home, of comfort, of friends and feeling safe in a harsh world.   Click here to listen to the [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08083BNaYcA).  Other river-related subthemes emerge.


Life goes on day after day  
Hearts torn in every way  
So ferry, cross the Mersey  
'Cause this land's the place I love  
And here I'll stay

People they rush everywhere  
Each with their own secret care  
So ferry, cross the Mersey  
And always take me there  
The place I love

People around every corner  
Seem to smile and say  
We don't care what your name is, boy  
We'll never turn you away  
So I'll continue to say  
Here I always will stay  
So ferry, cross the Mersey  
'Cause this land's the place I love  
And here I'll stay  
And here I'll stay  
Here I'll stay

**Bridges, Ferries and Fords**:   The ferry over the Mersey symbolizes the singer’s roots, security, and beloved home.  Perhaps the singer commutes on it to and from work.  For millennia people waded the shallow stretches to cross rivers.  Or perhaps atop a horse or ox they could handle deeper crossings.  At times, ropes, tree trunks, or strategically placed rocks helped them traverse the flow.  For deeper or wider rivers, small boats ferried goods and people back and forth.  Today, the largest commuter ferry system in the world is the Ferries in Istanbul, Turkey, per [The Biggest](https://the-biggest.net/buildings/what-is-the-largest-ferry-system-in-the-world.html), which carries upwards of 300,000 people each work day with 87 vessels serving 86 ports of call.  As far back as 5,000 years ago, people erected bridges, and later still avoided the perils and difficulties of rivers by digging tunnels under them.  Regarding tunnels, a table on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnels_underneath_the_River_Thames) lists tunnels under the Thames River in London:  12 for utilities, 15 for railroads, 5 roadways, 2 pedestrian, 1 floods, and 1 multipurpose – a total of 36!

**Cities and Industries**:  Astride the Mersey River, the port of Liverpool had grown to approximately 1.3 million residents when Gerry & the Pacemakers recorded their hit.  In the United States, however, only six of the ten largest cities boast a major river (Hudson [New York City], Illinois [Chicago], Delaware [Philadelphia], San Antonio [San Antonio], San Diego [San Diego], and Trinity [Dallas].   The other cities on that list have rivers, but they are small or short.  A river can become a synecdoche for a metropolis: the Thames, the Tiber, the Danube (Budapest), and the [Seine](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-03-rivers-from-the-seine-and-the-louvre-a-painting-by-camille-pissarro/riversseine/) come to mind.  And, who can forget the palaces of Kubla Khan on the [sacred river Alph](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-kubla-khan-a-poem-by-samuel-taylor-coleridge/riverskhan/).

Industries like proximity to a river.  Large power plants and factories crave the enormous quantities of water needed for cooling.  Manufacturers of petrochemicals, steel, and textiles also favored riverside locations for the barges that could ship in raw materials and take back finished products.  Canals are man-made rivers to supplement the transportation networks.  Industries also draw on dam turbines to power their machinery.

**Irrigation, Farming and Fishing**:  Around the world, farmers draw from rivers to water their crops.  Rivers nourished subsistence crops.  Since time immemorial, periodic flooding of mighty tributaries deposited fertile silt.  That boon is one reason the earliest civilizations flourished in the proximity of a major river: Mesopotamia amidst the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Egypt along the Nile, China on the Yellow River, and Indus on the Indus River.   

It used to be that river-dwellers obtained much of their protein from [fishing](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-a-river-runs-through-it-a-movie-by-robert-redford-starring-brad-pitt/riversruns/). Nets, traps, and lines brought in a large, steady supply of fish and once refrigerated transportation became available, the market expanded rapidly.  However, particularly in industrialized countries, over-fishing, pollution, and levee-building dramatically cut the tons of river fish caught.


A metaphorical anchor and bolster for the Liverpudlian singer, the Mersey River and the ferries that cross it bind him emotionally to his hometown.  Liverpool grew to become a major city because of its river and port.  Its early industries and farming relied on the Mersey.

## Additional Subthemes

The subthemes of Rivers discussed above arise from a [movie symbolized by bucolic fly fishing](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-a-river-runs-through-it-a-movie-by-robert-redford-starring-brad-pitt/riversruns/), Coleridge’s vision of a [capital city and its river Alph](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-kubla-khan-a-poem-by-samuel-taylor-coleridge/riverskhan/), a [symbolic ferry](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-02-rivers-from-ferry-cross-the-mersey-a-song-by-gerry-the-pacemakers/riversferry/), and a [Pissarro painting](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-10-03-rivers-from-the-seine-and-the-louvre-a-painting-by-camille-pissarro/riversseine/) of the Seine River in central Paris.   We consider more subthemes that do not link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Miscellaneous Associations**:  In the above posts, I passed on a number of ideas that might have become subthemes or been woven into the subthemes addressed.  What are the sources of names of rivers?  What are synonyms of “river”, the word for the largest version, but flowing bodies of water that are smaller might be called a runnel, stream, streamlet, tributary, creek, rill, rivulet, freshet, or brook.  I didn’t mention that house boats on rivers are plentiful.  Geographers can struggle to determine the precise spot where a river originates, its headwater (see the first entry in Records, below).  The posts for this theme refer to each of the previous 20 themes – can you spot them?  Waterfalls and gorges, or even the Grand Canyon, represent part of the natural beauty of rivers.  Millions of people find employment directly related to rivers, but I let that topic pass.

**Records**:   Here is a sample of the longest, most expensive, and other superlatives associated with Rivers.  

Longest – The Nile in Africa at 4,258 miles [6,853 km long] (although some say that the Amazon is longer, depending on where you determine its headwaters to be).  In addition to Egypt, it runs through Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Sudan, Burundi, and Congo-Kinshasa. [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/the-longest-rivers-in-the-world/photostory/84465554.cms)

Deepest – Congo, with a maximum depth of 720 feet. [World Atlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-is-the-deepest-river-in-the-world.html)

Most volume -- The Amazon is considered the world's largest river by volume.  [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/amazon-longer-than-nile-river)

Oldest – In the United States, the Susquehanna River is considered to be the oldest major river system (more than 300 million years old).  It is older than the Nile (30 million years old), the Colorado River (6-70 million years old), and the Ganges River (50 million years old), according to oldest.org.  But the Finke River in central Australia is believed to be the oldest river in the world because the oldest parts may be over 340 million years old.  [Oldest.org](https://www.oldest.org/nature/rivers/)

Longest river contained within a single U.S. state -- Trinity River, which flows through Dallas, stretches 710 miles entirely in Texas.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_River_(Texas)) 

Tallest dam -- Nurek Dam on the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan soars 984 feet (300 meters).  [US Bureau of Reclamation](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/biggest.html)

Largest hydroelectric power dam --  Three Gorges Dam in China has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts. [U.S. Dept. of the Interior](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/three-gorges-dam-worlds-largest-hydroelectric-plant?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
