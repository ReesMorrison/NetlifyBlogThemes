The subthemes of Dogs discussed above came to mind from a [poem about a dear dog](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-epitaph-to-a-dog-a-poem-by-george-gordon-lord-byron/dogsbyron/), a painting with [a solo dog walking on a bridge](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-la-pont-de-l-europe-by-gustave-caillebotte/dogsbridge/), a song of a [beloved dog and his emotional effect years after death](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-mr-bojangles-by-nitty-gritty-dirt-band/dogsjangles/), and a movie with a dramatic [scene of bloodhounds](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-14-dogs-from-cool-hand-luke-a-movie-with-paul-newman/dogscool/). Here are a few more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Origins of Word**:  The Old English word *docgena* or *dogga* was originally recorded around 1100 or slightly earlier, but rather than apply to all canines, it was the name of a large breed of dog.  [The Origins of “dog”](https://www.thehonestkitchen.com/blog/dozen-ways-dogs-infiltrated-english-language/) as a general term starts in the 1500s and 1600s, when the French used the word dogue, while the Germans and Dutch had the word dogge.   The word “dog” gradually began to be used for all canines, or at least all domesticated canines.  We do know that Princess Elizabeth of Great Britain said in 1550, “As a dog may hath a day, so may I perchance have time to declare it in deeds.”

**Books and Shows**:  Many books star a dog.  Here are a few notables: Lassie Come-Home by Eric Knight, Call of the Wild and White Fang by Jack London, Old Yeller by Fred Gipson, Jonathan Unleashed by Meg Rogoff, A Dog's Purpose by W. Bruce Cameron, and the incomparable Marley & Me by John Grogan.  Movie adaptations have appeared based on the popular dog books.  And who can forget Toto?

**Records**:  Paw your way through these superlatives related to Dogs.
