"You’ve Got a Friend," written by Carol King and made famous by the singing of James Taylor, describes with everyday language how good friends respond immediately when they are needed.  If your predicament aches for some *lovin’ care*, soon you will be nursed and revived if you have a stalwart, reliable friend.  What else does this song suggest about friendships?

Here it is, [sung by an older James Taylor.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WJ1cf3nrLE)


When you're down and troubled  
And you need some lovin' care  
And nothin', nothin' is goin' right  
Close your eyes and think of me  
And soon I will be there  
To brighten up even your darkest night  

You just call out my name  
And you know, wherever I am  
I'll come runnin'  
To see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there  
You've got a friend  

If the sky above you  
Grows dark and full of clouds  
And that old north wind begins to blow  
Keep your head together  
And call my name out loud  
Soon you'll hear me knockin' at your door  

You just call out my name  
And you know, wherever I am  
I'll come runnin', runnin', yeah, yeah  
To see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there, yes, I will  

Now, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend  
When people can be so cold?  
They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you  
And take your soul if you let them  
Oh, but don't you let them  

You just call out my name  
And you know, wherever I am  
I'll come runnin', runnin', yeah, yeah  
To see you again  
Winter, spring, summer or fall  
All you have to do is call  
And I'll be there, yes, I will

**Emotions**:  James Taylor’s friend immediately responds to the call for help, *I'll be there, yes, I will*.  He sings calmly, but the warmth of reliable, deep affection glows.  Nobody can make it out here by themself and cold people will 

*hurt you, yes, and desert you*  
*And take your soul if you let them.*  

Strong friendships go hand in hand with strong emotions.  When you care for someone deeply, they know secrets about you that can stab and you can stab back.  Anger can be the lava of loving friendships’ magma; it wells up from our core and when white hot it destroys.  On the positive side, the depth of feeling can be transporting.  We soar on a higher plane around that person: “I like you so very much.”  Powerful affect accompanies strong bonds of friendship, much like in marriages.  With great friendship comes great responsibility since the price of closeness is vulnerability and loss.

**Physical Touching and Sensing**: The friend in this song shows up *knockin’ at your door* and hugs -- not for them the pallid brevity of text or email, the delay of a letter, or the sensory-deprivation of a phone call; they stand before you, embracing, in touch with you and your life.  *Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend*.  Yes, you can have pen pals and epistolary liaisons (Peter Tchaikovsky and his patron, Nadezhda von Meck would be a notable example).  But text messages and emojis don’t consummate relationships, and no one marries based on the blurb of a dating site.  To hold someone is to know them.

Friendships build best in person, not when you are [alone](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-alone-a-poem-by-maya-angelou/friendsalone/).  [Picnics together](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-luncheon-on-the-grass-a-painting-by-edouard-manet/friendsluncheon/), concerts, travel, sleepovers, dormitory debates, military service, long walks and talks – those are friendship’s bricks.  In "The Big Chill,"" the catalyst for so many revelations was the weekend in sight of each other, in the kitchen, and in each other’s arms.

**Connections**: A signal characteristic of friends [gathered together](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-06-20-friends-the-big-chill-a-movied-directed-by-lawrence-kasdan/friendschill/) is a flurry of in-jokes, teasing, shared memories, networks, and sensitivities.  Friends share many connections, which they can weave into their conversations and build on continuously with anecdotes, remember-whens and embellished retellings.  A web of memories and stories, sometimes legends polished over time, binds a person to their friends.  The longer friendships last, the deeper and more entwined become those shared experiences.  “Remember the picnic with those weird women….”

We care about our close friends, who pitch in at once when needed.  They come to us, draw on their history with us, and hold us.  Emotions wash over us, both good and bad feelings.  This song stresses the support, immediacy, and presence of a friend.
