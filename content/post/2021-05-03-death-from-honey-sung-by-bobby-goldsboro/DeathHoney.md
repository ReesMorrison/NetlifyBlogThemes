A tearful song, “Honey (I Miss You)” bares the deep loss of a man devastated by the death of *honey*.   Although she *went away* more than two years before, he obsessively replays her time with him and grieves.  The song elicits several subthemes of Death.

“Honey,” sung by Bobby Goldsboro 

See the tree, how big it's grown  
But friend, it hasn't been too long  
It wasn't big  
I laughed at her, and she got mad 
The first day that she planted it  
Was just a twig  

[lyrics omitted]

She was always young at heart  
Kinda dumb, and kinda smart  
And I loved her so  
And I surprised her with a puppy  
Kept me up all Christmas eve  
Two years ago  

[lyrics omitted]

And honey, I miss you  
And I'm bein' good  
And I'd love to be with you  
If only I could  

[lyrics omitted]

I came home unexpectedly  
And caught her cryin' needlessly  
In the middle of the day  
And it was in the early spring  
When flowers bloom, and robins sing  
She went away  

[refrain omitted]

One day while I was not at home  
While she was there, and all alone  
The angels came  
Now all I have are memories of honey  
And I wake up nights  
And call her name  

Now my life's an empty stage  
Where honey lived, and honey played  
And love grew up  
And a small cloud passes overhead  
And cries down on the flower bed  
That honey loved  

[final stanza omitted]

**Grief and Heartbreak**:  The sudden death of someone we dearly love throws us into grief.  When honey *went away* it crushed the spirit of her husband.  He has since passed through a few of the well-known stages of grief: the first being shock and denial, when we simply refuse to accept the first news flash that the President has been shot in Dealey Plaza and killed.  Next, pain and guilt, where we regret what we might have done to prevent the tragedy.  Many then move to anger directed at someone who should have done something to avert the death, followed possibly by depression, which therapists attribute to anger turned inward.  He may have [contemplated suicide](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-05-03-death-from-bonnie-clyde-a-movie-starring-warren-beatty-and-faye-dunaway/deathbonnie/).   Eventually reconstruction and working through of the survivor’s life gradually takes place, and, finally, acceptance of the death and hope.  Given the endless recounting of his loss, his house may be known to neighbors as [the widower’s house](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-05-03-death-from-house-of-the-hanged-man-a-painting-by-paul-cezanne/deathhanged/).

**Afterlife**:   People of faith believe that [a reward follows our time on earth, if lived righteously](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-05-03-death-from-death-be-not-proud-a-poem-by-john-donne/deathdonne/).  For Christians it is Heaven, for Muslims it is Paradise (Jannah ) and for Hindus the hope is Moksha.   Similarly to Judaism, Islam believes that on the Day of Judgment,  Allah will resurrect everyone, judge them and send them either to Paradise or Hell.  The husband wishes he could join honey in the afterlife:  

*And I'd love to be with you*  
*If only I could*

**Religion**:  The song alludes to religion because of the reference to Christmas eve and *the angels came* for honey.  The churchlike choral background to Bobby Goldsboro’s singing also reminds us of beatific angels.  We don’t hear of the singer praying for his wife’s return or questioning how a benevolent deity could have allowed her to die, but a short song can only do so much to invoke religious sentiment.  For many people, their religion not only frames how they prepare for death but also gives them reassurance about life after death.

&nbsp;

Listeners weep when they hear this moving lament.  Devastated by the inexplicable and sudden loss of his beloved Honey, the singer relives his tender and endearing memories leading to that terrible spring day.  He hasn’t passed through the steps of grief and he hasn’t found solace in religion or philosophy.  His heart broken by her death, he remains stuck in his sadness.
