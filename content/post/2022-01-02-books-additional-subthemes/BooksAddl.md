The subthemes of Books discussed above came to mind from a [poem by an author reflecting on an  unauthorized book](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-01-books-from-the-author-to-her-book-a-poem-by-anne-bradstreet/booksbradstreet/), a painting of [books piled on a table](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-02-books-from-still-life-with-books-a-painting-by-vincent-van-gogh/booksstill/), a [plea by a writer of paperback novels](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-02-books-from-paperback-rider-by-the-beatles/bookspaperback/), and a movie about [book informed youth](https://themesfromart.com/post/2022-01-02-books-from-good-will-hunting-a-movie-with-matt-damon-robin-williams-and-ben-afleck/bookshunting/).   Here are more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Records**:  We offer you a tiny tome of superlatives related to Books.

*Most expensive, religious – in 2017, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints spent $35 million on a handwritten printer’s manuscript from 1830 of the Book of Mormon.  The most expensive Bible ever is a Gutenberg Bible that sold for \\$5.39 million (\\$12.2 million in 2016 dollars) in 1987; the most expensive Talmud went for \\$9.3 million in 2015; and the most expensive Quran was a 7th century fragment that sold for \\$4.9 million (\\$5.8 million) in 2008.

**Expressions**:   Figurative sayings related to Books are not voluminous.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes on this blog, see Work Additional Subthemes(). For this collection of 23, aside from identifying expressions myself, I drew on [Expresso English[(https://www.espressoenglish.net/10-english-expressions-with-the-word-book/), [English with a Twist](https://englishwithatwist.com/2015/03/11/10-idioms-about-books/), and [English on Your Mind](https://englishonyourmind.wordpress.com/2018/02/03/10-idioms-and-expressions-using-the-word-book/).  Expressions do not include proverbs, such as “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” Or similes: “His face is like an open book.”
