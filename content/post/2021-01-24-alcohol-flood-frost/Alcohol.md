# description: Subthemes of alcohol drinking in the poem of an old, lonely man walking home and sipping
# ---

“Mr. Flood’s Party,” one poem in Edgar Lee Masters’ "Spoon River Anthology" (1915), touches your heart with a brief, sad scene cheered a little by the liquor in a jug.  An elderly man trudges back from a town to his lonely sleeping place, carrying a jug of low-grade alcohol.  He stops in the brightness of the moon, imagines a drinking companion who is himself, and in a mock party draws on the jug a few times before plodding on.  The quaffs lighten the gloom for the solitary man, if only for a few minutes, even drawing from him a burst of song, but then the darkness, the seclusion, the losses of former friends, and the emptiness of his remaining life consumes the brief happiness created by the drinks.

Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night  
Over the hill between the town below  
And the forsaken upland hermitage  
That held as much as he should ever know  
On earth again of home, paused warily.  
The road was his with not a native near;  
And Eben, having leisure, said aloud,  
For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear: 

"Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon    
Again, and we may not have many more;   
The bird is on the wing, the poet says,   
And you and I have said it here before.   
Drink to the bird." He raised up to the light   
The jug that he had gone so far to fill,   
And answered huskily: "Well, Mr. Flood,   
Since you propose it, I believe I will."   

Alone, as if enduring to the end   
A valiant armor of scarred hopes outworn,   
He stood there in the middle of the road   
Like Roland's ghost winding a silent horn.   
Below him, in the town among the trees,   
Where friends of other days had honored him,   
A phantom salutation of the dead   
Rang thinly till old Eben's eyes were dim.   

Then, as a mother lays her sleeping child   
Down tenderly, fearing it may awake,   
He set the jug down slowly at his feet   
With trembling care, knowing that most things break;   
And only when assured that on firm earth   
It stood, as the uncertain lives of men   
Assuredly did not, he paced away,   
And with his hand extended paused again:   

“Well, Mr. Flood, we have not met like this   
In a long time; and many a change has come   
To both of us, I fear, since last it was   
We had a drop together. Welcome home!"   
Convivially returning with himself,   
Again he raised the jug up to the light;   
And with an acquiescent quaver said:   
"Well, Mr. Flood, if you insist, I might.   

"Only a very little, Mr. Flood—   
For auld lang syne. No more, sir; that will do."   
So, for the time, apparently it did,   
And Eben evidently thought so too;   
For soon amid the silver loneliness   
Of night he lifted up his voice and sang,   
Secure, with only two moons listening,   
Until the whole harmonious landscape rang—   

"For auld lang syne." The weary throat gave out,   
The last word wavered; and the song being done,   
He raised again the jug regretfully   
And shook his head, and was again alone.   
There was not much that was ahead of him,   
And there was nothing in the town below—   
Where strangers would have shut the many doors   
That many friends had opened long ago.

Each of the seven stanzas refers to alcohol, implicitly in the first and third, but explicitly in the other five stanzas.  The poet shares with us several views of alcohol.  

**Social Disapproval**.  At the start (stanza 1, line 5), Eben Flood paused *warily*, self-conscious and a touch nervous about what he is about to do.  He is sensitive to the possibility that a town resident might spot him indulging and disapprove of him.  His small-town, late 19th century America included many advocates of temperance: they frowned at drinking alcoholic beverages, and one would suppose they frowned even more so at indulging in the Devil’s brew while alone.  Flood didn’t want the approbation of his community, but he had trudged into town for the purchase and wanted a drink, so he made sure no one else was around.  This caution hurts, given the emphasis in the poem on Flood’s loneliness:  he made sure he was alone before he sought out the balm of the bottle.

**Toasting**.  Carrying over into the second stanza, Flood conjures up a drinking buddy (himself, it seems) who urbanely urges him to drink to the bird, a reference to a line in the “Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam”  (life passes by, *the bird is on the wing*).   Huskily, with deep feelings stirring, Eben accepts the imagined invitation to toast.  His voice might have changed because Eben was changing characters, or more likely Masters’ carefully chosen word huskily suggests the sadness within Flood.  Either way, the traditional form of a toast made by clinking glasses and drinking alcohol finds expression in this stanza.

The third stanza draws on metaphors of battle to represent Flood’s difficult life.  It concludes in lines 5 through 8 with allusions to toasts that others have raised to him (*Where friends of other days had honored him, A phantom salutation of the dead*).   As Proust’s famous madeleine evoked memories of times past, the taste from the jug revived Floods long-ago revelries, which faded in Floods mind’s eye.  Alcohol plays a prominent role in social gatherings, and salutations of “cheers” standout in them.

**Expensive**. Extending the “party”, Flood and his alter ego pause in the following stanza (the fourth), cherish the jug and tenderly rest it and its remaining drink on the ground.  [Alcohol can be expensive](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-woolf-nichols/) and to break the bottle a waste and a shame.  Flood has spent a significant amount for him to fill his jug and he takes pains to protect it.

In the fifth stanza, the imaginary friend proposes another toast and Convivially returning with himself, Flood tips the jug once again to his lips.  He is enjoying his small occasion and the [effects of the drink](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-01-alcohol-margaritaville-buffet/).  He relishes even a made-up companion and even more the glow and altered state that the jug’s contents provides.  One can be sure it was nothing as mild as beer, wine isn’t for jugs, so this was potent homebrew moonshine with a kick.

**Respite and Relief**. Whatever he filled his jug with in the town below, it gladdens him.  Alcohol blankets him that chill night with several minutes of relief, of pushing away the grinding of age and poverty, and even bubbles up some flights of song Until the whole harmonious landscape rang.   The *no more, sir; that will do.* reminds the reader that often when alcohol is being served someone shows signs of over-indulging and losing the composure that is expected of them.   Others caution the drinker to pause or stop, such as [in a cafe early in the morning](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-absinthe-degas/).

The emotion the final stanza invokes – weary, last word, song done -- the passing away just ahead of Eben Flood darkens the poem.  Flood has reached the end of a long life, the dark at the end of his tunnel, and has scant pleasure to give him solace.  The pretense of intimate swallows alone at night with a friend he wishes he had pose for much that remains Eben as warmth, camaraderie and pleasure.  He creates a small measure of relief from a rock-hard life in the taste and effect and shared companionship of toasts and drinks.   The choice, to days gone by and old friends now lost, foreshadows the hurt of loss of friends that ends the poem.   Alcohol helps sufferers forget for a while, but the buzz dissipates and life storms back in.  

*He raised again the jug regretfully*
*And shook his head, and was again alone.*

Old Eben Flood filled with regret as he considered another quaff, perhaps because too little was left – his pleasure was gone – or perhaps because the pangs of a former, happier life struck, or perhaps because he knows that that jug could be empty but hard-scrabble life would plod on.


In this foray into the sociology, physiology, and psychology of drinking alcohol, the poem delves into the guilty pleasure that elicits concerns about being criticized by non-drinkers, the bonhomie of raising a glass to and with others, the disinhibition of song that often mixes with drink, and the pleasure while the glow lasts.  Toward the end of his lonely life, Eben Flood finds solace and escape in the jug, but reality takes over at the end.


A beach bum, awash in margaritas [Note 1], boozily staggers through this ballad of rueful retrospection.  He concludes that he is to blame for his plight, not some unnamed woman.  But the connotations we concentrate on in Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville” emanate from alcohol.  The blended deliciousness of margaritas cozens him yet robs him of clear thinking and sucks mature control from his life.  The alcohol, we will see, gives him refuge but removes his agency.

“Margaritaville” (written and sung by Jimmy Buffet)

Nibblin' on sponge cake  
Watchin' the sun bake  
All of those tourists covered with oil  
Strummin' my six string  
On my front porch swing  
Smell those shrimp, they're beginnin' to boil  
	
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville  
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt  
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, it's nobody's fault  	

Don't know the reason  
Stayed here all season  
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo  
But it's a real beauty  
A Mexican cutie  
How it got here, I haven't a clue  
	
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville  
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt  
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  
Now I think, hell, it could be my fault  
	
I blew out my flip flop  
Stepped on a pop top  
Cut my heel, had to cruise on back home  
But there's booze in the blender  
And soon it will render  
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on  
	
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville  
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt  
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  
But I know, it's my own damn fault  
	
Yes, and some people claim  
That there's a woman to blame  
And I know, it's my own damn fault  


![margarita in glass](/media/AlcoholMargarita.jpg)

**Robs Purpose**: The start of the song sets the scene: vacation-like, purposeless relaxation.  The first line of the first stanza of Jimmy Buffet’s “Margaritaville” hints that the undirected singer eats poorly, nibblin’ on sponge cake, and that a total lack of schedule or commitments surrounds his day-to-day boredom and aimlessness.  Watching lazily and without purpose at tourists getting sunburned leads nowhere.  But why is this soul so lost?

First heard in stanza two, the refrain clarifies his slough of purposelessness: the singer is treading margaritas, so to speak: his life is frozen as he finds surcease from sorrow through swilling margaritas.  

*Wastin' away again in Margaritaville*
*Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt*

These refrain lines repeat the name of the drink that has subdued the depressed singer.  We should unpack it.

  Wastin’ away conjures up the physical toll of consuming too much alcohol for too long.  Chronic drinkers tend to eat poorly -- sponge cake! -- and over time may lose weight and strength – they literally waste away.  But the phrase and blank-eyed gazing also suggests the loss of direction, the long stretches of doing nothing, the draining away of vitality – what a waste! 

  As for the missing salt shaker, many people drink margaritas with salt on the rim of the glass, but they don’t add the salt by using a shaker (they dip the glass upside down into salt).  That might be the meaning of the fruitless search or it could be the aimless perseveration of someone continuously three sheets to the wind.  Most profoundly, he is searching for the cause of his despair and the metaphor of the salt shaker conveys that goal.

We are given to understand that depression from a [collapsed marriage](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-woolf-nichols/) or love affair triggered the slide into vagrant tippling.

Back to the lyrics and stanza three.  We’re at a Mexican beach resort the singer has sardonically dubbed Margaritaville.  Geography and proper names have drizzled away; all that matters to him is the fruity mix laced with tequila that blanks out his hurt.  The singer lacks a compass in his life.  

*Don't know the reason*
*Stayed here all season*

**Weakens Decision-Making**:  He can’t manage to pull himself together and figure out how to recover from the emotional blow.  Without a plan, he stayed near the beach, not deliberately but from an inability to cope and step away from his sodden plight, and resorted to drinking.  In the second portion of the stanza, we glimpse how far he is gone.  With too many margaritas, he makes poor decisions (don’t know the reason) or impulsive choices.

*Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo*

*But it's a real beauty*
*A Mexican cutie*

Too drunk to know he got a tattoo that looks like a local young lady, he can’t recall anything: 

*How it got here, I haven't a clue.*  

Blotto, out of it, he impulsively paid for a tattoo that afterwards he can’t account for.  Amnesia follows from the worst benders.  So, I haven’t a clue.

The seduction of warmth, low costs, and the siren-like beckoning of potent fruity drinks have robbed the singer of his ability to make longer-term decisions.   Or perhaps the singer had already lost his bearings, so it was easy to submerge in tropical indolence and abandonment in the cups.

**Physical Risks**:  After another refrain, which subtly shows him narrowing in on the truth, the fifth stanza reminds us that if you over-consume alcohol you run a greater risk of getting hurt.  Your balance, reactions and judgment are out of kilter. [Note 2] He doesn’t take care of his meager possessions (*I blew out my flip flop*) so when he stepped on a sharp bottle top (probably from a can, a pop top) he cut his foot badly enough to make him turn back to where he stays.  Note the unurgent *cruised back home* to the comforting nurse of his favorite beverage (a bit like the [jug for Eben Flood](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-01-24-alcohol-flood-frost/alcoholfloodindex/)).  
 
*But there's booze in the blender*
*And soon it will render*
*That frozen concoction that helps me hang on*

**Temporary Respite**: One of the many terms for a drunken spree is a “bender”, which Jimmy Buffet teases out of the listener with the rhymes of blender and render.  Alcohol buoys up people for a period of feeling better, cushioning the pain of life that that they would rather flee.  Also, to be fair, many people enjoy the taste of their favorite liquor.  Our beach bum likes margaritas on their way down, to say nothing of their balming effect.

Sadly, many people who can’t cope with the vicissitudes of life pour their way to temporary oblivion: alcoholic flight from the actual.  It helps me hang on, but like drugs the effect of the margarita inevitably wears off, inevitably for the world and its hurtful cuts of pop tops to crash the party.  Put another way, [absinthe buys a bit of time](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-absinthe-degas/).

In the final stanza, the seventh, he penetrates the fog of margaritas and comes to the truth: it’s my own damn fault.  Did he lose his wife or girlfriend from drinking too much?  Personal accountability for drinking is part of the realization.  He realizes that his inability to stop drinking demonstrates yet another self-inflicted mistake. 


Why he has sunk to this forlorn state we never learn, but the constant theme is drinking alcohol.  He drinks to forget, to cope with being overwhelmed emotionally, or because he is an alcoholic and doesn’t want withdrawal pains. Alcoholics are addicted to their drug.


This slice-of-life song brings up positives of alcohol.  It tastes good and it brings a pleasant buzz to people as it dulls the sharp edges of life.  But the song also vividly conveys or hints at the deleterious effects of too much alcohol: poor health, increased risks, sloppy decisions, diminished self-control, and physical addiction.

Note 1. The ingredients of a margarita might be of interest.  Nothing nutritious, except you won’t get scurvy.
•	2 ounces blanco tequila 
•	1/2 ounce orange liqueur

Note 2: In the United States [drunk-driving crashes claim more than 10,000 lives per year](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving). 

At the focus spot of a well-known painting by Edgar Degas, "The Absinthe" ["L?  Absinthe"], sits a full glass of absinthe.  According  [to one summary](https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/work-of-the-week-edgar-degas-in-a-cafe-the-absinthe-drinker-dans-un-cafe-labsinthe/), "Absinthe (also known as La Fée Verte or "the green fairy") was a green colored, highly alcoholic spirit. Poured over ice and served with water and a cube of sugar to soften the bitter taste, it was [thought to be] highly addictive and known to cause hallucinations."  In this early morning scene from a mid-19th century Parisian café [Note 1], the woman and her companion, despite their youthfulness in their lower 30', exude fatigue, emptiness and depression.

**Legal Restrictions**: Its growing popularity and its negative social effects led to absinthe being banned in much of Europe and America."  More broadly, alcohol for consumption swirls in a cloud of legal restrictions.  You must be of majority age to drink, certain kinds of alcohol are illegal, driving under the influence carries heavy penalties, sales are regulated and highly taxed.   At the extreme, the Eighteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibited alcohol in the United States starting January 16, 1919.   Much of the animus against drinking alcohol arises from moralistic prudery, but also awareness of drunken misbehavior.  

The woman stares down into space with heavy eyes, her shoulders drooped and the pale absinthe on the table in front of her. The painting exudes melancholy, with its palette of muted greys and soft earth tones suggesting stale air and melancholy.  She looks sad, with hardly enough strength to pick up the goblet.  Small wonder.

**Depressant**:Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, meaning that it slows down brain functioning and neural activity. Alcohol does this by enhancing the effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. Alcohol can slur speech, unsteady movement, disturb perceptions, and slow reactions. Alcohol impairs the ability to think rationally, lessens inhibitions, and distorts judgment. 

Paradoxically, while partaking sometimes animates drinkers, eventually it swings to depressing them. The picture has a soggy, subdued aura that displays the opposite of conviviality. Neither person cares to talk, looking worse for wear after a long night.   Both appear lost in reveries or burdened by dulled senses.  Whether the pall is cast by fatigue, extensive drinking, poor health, a bitter argument between them we cannot tell.  But the effervescent light-heartedness often associated with having a glass or three finds no place in this scene, unlike in ["Margaritaville" by Jimmy Buffet.](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-01-alcohol-margaritaville-buffet/)

**Hangovers**: As a third sub-theme of alcohol, hangovers may plague the couple. [Note 2] To the side of her surly companion stands a glass filled with a brown drink (possibly mazagran, a cold coffee beverage thought to be a hangover cure).  She may be trying the "hair of the dog," a phrased derived from the medieval belief that, when someone was bitten by a rabid dog, a cure could be applying the same dog's hair to the wound. [Note 3]

**Destabilizing**: Finally, those who ponder the painting might note a number of disconcerting features, akin to the instability caused by excessive of drinking.  

  It is early morning judging from the brightness on her blouse and the shadows on the mirror behind that tell us the sun is low, so it is probably morning. Yet aside from a few well-known libations at brunches (Mimosas, Bloody Mary's), most people [drink in the evening.](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-woolf-nichols/) Thus, this glimpse of two people in the cups early in the morning jars the viewer.  It subliminally connects drinking and falling out of bodily rhythm.
  
  Likewise, the composition of the picture is off kilter. The triangle of her hair, the water bottle and the absinthe is above the middle of the painting. Odd objects to the lower left leave an impression of imbalance, such as results from excessive alcohol. We see tabletops and bench backs, but they are all cropped, foreshortened, unbalanced. An unfinished dress peeks between the tables. The visual clues disorient in the way that drinking too much affects perception and balance.

A multitude of open questions perturb the viewer, along the lines of the cognitive confusion brought on by too much alcohol.

  What is their relationship? We are inclined to consider the two a couple, simply because of how close they are sitting, but a mystery remains.

  Why are they awake and drinking this early?

  How long have they been at the café?  We can't tell whether the woman has just ordered the absinthe or whether her drinking bout has been going for some time.  
  
  The two people look exhausted but why don't they go home [like old Eben Flood?](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-01-24-alcohol-flood-frost/alcoholfloodindex/)

  What are the bizarre items in the front left  of the frame?

Degas' masterpiece centers on a glass of absinthe that is as full as the moment is empty.  He chose a dangerous liquor that was eventually made illegal, he surrounds it with palpable depression and visual effects that map to the effects of drinking too much.


Notes:
1.	The cafe pictured La Nouvelle Athnes, in Place Pigalle, was one frequented by modern artists and intellectual bohemians.  Place Pigalle has long been considered to be a red light district.

2.	Various factors may contribute to a hangover. For example:
    --	Alcohol causes your body to produce more urine. In turn, urinating more than usual can lead to dehydration often indicated by thirst, dizziness and lightheadedness.
    --	Alcohol triggers an inflammatory response from your immune system. Your immune system may trigger certain agents that commonly produce physical symptoms, such as an inability to concentrate, memory problems, decreased appetite and loss of interest in usual activities.
    --	Alcohol irritates the lining of your stomach. Alcohol increases the production of stomach acid and delays stomach emptying. Any of these factors can cause abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting.
    --	Alcohol can cause your blood sugar to fall. If your blood sugar dips too low, you may experience fatigue, weakness, shakiness, mood disturbances and even seizures.
    --	Alcohol causes your blood vessels to expand, which can lead to headaches.
    --	Alcohol can make you sleepy, but it prevents deeper stages of sleep and often causes awakening in the middle of the night. This may leave you groggy and tired.
3.	[One commentator](https://www.addictioncenter.com/alcohol/is-alcohol-a-depressant/) notes that For many people, alcohol consumption is a means of relaxation; however, the effects of alcohol and hangovers can actually induce anxiety and increase stress.   


At the start of this scene from Edward Albee’s play, a wife (Martha, Elizabeth Taylor) verbally attacks her husband (George, Richard Burton), who plays an Associate Professor of History at the college led by Martha’s father. With two shocked guests presents, she paces as she swirls a cocktail glass with ice and a half drink in it.  She has been drinking steadily.

If you would like to watch the 1:41 scene as it was directed by Mike Nichols, [here it is on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nInE5TITzE8 "Scene on YouTube").  The dialogue below comes from [script-o-rama.](http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/w/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf-script.html) 

Martha: I actually fell for him.  It! That! There!  

George: Martha's a romantic at heart.

Martha: That I am.  I actually fell for him.  And the match seemed practical too.
Martha: For a while Daddy thought George had the stuff...  ...to take over when he was ready to retire.
  
George: - Stop it!   - What do you want?! I wouldn't go on if I were you.

Martha: - You wouldn't? Well, you're not!  You've already sprung a leak about you-know-what.
  
George: What?
  
Martha: About the little bugger. Our son.
  
George: If you start in on this, I warn you...
  
Martha: - I stand warned.

George: - Do we have to go through this?
  
Martha: Anyway, I married the S.O.B.  I had it all planned out.  First he'd take over the History Department, then the whole college.  That's how it was supposed to be!

Martha: Getting angry?  That was how it was supposed to be.  All very simple.  Daddy thought it was a good idea too.  For a while!  Until he started watching for a couple of years.  Getting angry?
  
Martha: Till he watched for a couple years... ...and started thinking it wasn't such a good idea.  That maybe Georgie-boy didn't have the stuff!  That he didn't have it in him!
  
George: - Stop it, Martha!

Martha: - Like hell, I will!  George didn't have much push.  He wasn't aggressive.  In fact, he was sort of a flop!
  
Martha: A great big, fat flop!
  
George: I said stop it!  [Smashes fist down and sound of glass breaking]
  
Martha: I hope that was an empty bottle.  You can't afford to waste good liquor.  Not on your salary! Not on an associate professor's salary!


Martha’s scorning tirade against her husband holds nothing back; the liquor in her has unloosed her raging anger and biting attacks.  She will say anything, including the most hurtful charges against his capabilities (*A great big, fat flop!*) and indeed his manhood (*Georgie-boy*). Her diminished or non-existent inhibition characterizes many people who drink more alcohol than they can handle.  They can say or do things that when sober they wouldn’t contemplate.

**Loss of Control**. Some heavy drinkers become quiet, [such as the women in "Absinthe"](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-absinthe-degas/), some strident; men and women may react differently.  But in the scene from the movie, Martha pours out the vitriol she has marinaded in on her husband seemingly totally unconcerned about the pain she is causing him and also oblivious to the shock and deep discomfort of their two guests (played by George Peppard and Sandy Dennis).   She twice mocks her husband: “Getting angry?”  And he, who has also been drinking throughout the evening, grows angry. Both are coming apart with the alcohol coursing through them.

**Aggressiveness**: Aside from stripping away self-control, [as did the beach bum of Buffet](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-01-alcohol-margaritaville-buffet/), alcohol sometimes pumps up combativeness.  Aggressiveness and belligerence mark a common reaction of people who are “three sheets to the wind” [Note 1].  In this scene from “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf” the wife is spoiling for a fight, bullying and poking at her husband verbally – daring him to rise up. Alcohol, exacerbating a long marriage encrusted by dislike and disrespect, fuels her clobbering him with sarcasm and viciousness.

**Costly**: At the end of this short scene, George boils over (*I said stop it!*) and smashes his hand down on something that was holding a bottle of alcohol.  The bottle shatters on the floor and Martha reacts with another tirade against her husband’s failure to be promoted to full professor.  She *hope[s] that was an empty bottle.  You can't afford to waste good liquor.  Not on your salary!  Not on an associate professor's salary!*  [As Eben Flood was well aware](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-01-24-alcohol-flood-frost/alcoholfloodindex/), quality alcohol costs money. 

**Not to Be Reasoned With**: Another aspect of alcohol consumption appears in the scene. It can be difficult or impossible to reason with someone who is deeply under the influence. Rationality doesn’t work with the drunk. Here the two spouses have clearly been at each other’s throats for a while, and neither can recover or restore some semblance of a truce, but the night of binging makes it impossible.

Difficult as it may be to endure this movie scene of marital enmity, the background messages regarding alcohol seep through. Often when people drink they unearth aspects of themselves that they keep hidden under normal circumstances.  Anger, attacks and irrationality bubble to the surface and drinkers can’t control blurting them out.  Sometimes, lack of self-control degenerates into physical or verbal abuse.  Someone who is drunk can’t be reasoned with and may sink to the most primal modes of might makes right and anything goes.  Finally, while it is easy to find cheap versions of any liquor, if someone savors brands and quality distilled spirits, they must be prepared to pay handsomely for the pleasure.  The conviviality, good feeling and smooth taste of emptying the glass, as well as the negative mood and behavior changes, empties the pocket.

The four preceding sections of this chapter have discussed sub-themes of the broader theme of alcohol:

["Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-woolf-nichols/)
["Absinthe" by Edgar Degas](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-03-alcohol-absinthe-degas/)
["Margaritaville" by Jimmy Buffet](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-02-01-alcohol-margaritaville-buffet/) and
["Mr. Flood's Party" by Edwin Arlington Robinson](https://themesfromart.com/blog/2021-01-24-alcohol-flood-frost/alcoholfloodindex/)

Having explored sub-themes of alcohol that suggest themselves primarily in only one of the four artistic forms, I want to close with several additional observations that deserve mention.  We’ll start with five sub-themes shared by two or more these mini-stories, and then consider a few of other paired considerations.

**Loneliness**: Loneliness cries out in these pieces:  The old man trudging back alone in the cold to his hermitage, the sodden expatriate in Mexico who yearns for a woman back home, the café demimonde locked in the solitary confinement of her musings, and the warring couple on the precipice of divorce’s separation.  Perhaps alcohol didn’t cause these plights of loneliness, but it may well have worsened them.  The behavior of people who tickle too much can alienate friends and neighbors. Acquaintances and family fall away; someone with alcoholic tendencies find themselves unwelcome and uninvited.

**Despondency**:  Sadness seeps out of each of these works, and not simply because of the pervasively loneliness.  Mr. Flood lives by himself without companions, the margarita-lover can’t recover as he misses a lost woman, the dawn drinker doesn’t radiate that absinthe makes the heart grow fonder; and the loathing in “Virginia Woolf” bites deeper than mere sadness. Drinking too often or too much contributes to despondency both as a physical downer and as a weakener of capabilities.  Alcohol can be fingered as the cause of melancholy but as we discuss below it can also romp hand-in-hand with fun and games.  But none of these mini-stories suggests that good side of alcohol.

**Handicaps**:  Each work radiates struggle, tension, conflict.  Old Eben Flood wishes he still were welcome but the doors in the town below stay shut. He worries about being overseen swigging from the jug and judged. He’s torn between trying to revive friendships or drinking by himself. In the painting, an exhausted argument, embers of friendship or love burning low, or a reluctance to trudge home suggests tensions between them or hardships facing them. In the movie, tension understates the searing fury that makes the scene so difficult to watch. Martha flashes razor-like comments with a “mind like a scorpion” (Macbeth) as the two roar over blame for their crushed dreams. Finally, the beach guy yearns for more than floundering in a glass of a sorry Mexican shanty, but he can’t shake the trauma of losing someone in his past.  Not that alcohol on its own necessarily provokes struggles but it can exacerbate strife and handicap a person’s ability to cope difficulties. 

**Flight**: Given the loneliness, despondency, constraints and generally lousy effects of alcohol conveyed by these four glimpses of life, small wonder the protagonists seek escape from the bottle.  But even deeper the escape carries its own paid; they would like to set aside at least for a moment the realities they face: poverty and solitude, broken heart, a hurt from the Parisian night, or shattered marital hopes.   Alcohol can help from escape for a while from  hurtful reality – but the reprieve is short.   Worse, margaritas mortgage your future.

Similarly, hallucinatory drugs, promiscuous sex, mosh-pit dance, throbbing music, and religious rites all enable ecstatic escape.  They remove participants from daily indignities and psychic wounds.  Sadly, all Bacchanalias wear off and the harsh world comes crashing back.  Moreover slipping from the bonds of reality frightens sober, hard-working, Puritan-ethic folk.  Culture and its fist, the law, clamp down on these outlets of temporary release out of fear that civilization unloose its discontents.  All societies have constrained the perceived dangers of ecstatic excess.  Drunkenness has consequences.

**Positive and Negative**: The residue of these pieces is solidly negative – alcohol is actively destructive, a solvent dissolving good behavior and self-maintenance.  Each piece repeats the pattern of people trying to dull the edge of personal pain. Flood’s not having a party, he’s talking to himself, regretting his lost friends, exile from his own happier, earlier life, and banished probably from good society as an old drunk. He walked a long way in the cold just to buy a jug of booze, which he downs alone. He’s in pain.  Degas’ woman is also in pain, painted in muted colors and blurry strokes, and having yet another drink to take the edge off.  She seems too sad, or too exhausted, even to sip her glass, like  the singer who staggers around blending the concoction while knowing it’s really not helping – his problems are his own damn fault.  In “Woolf” the cocktails are gasoline poured on a smouldering history of dislike that blew up what was rancid and irreparable. 

When scrutinized and unpacked, these four particular sips of alcohol through art emphasize the negative.  However, the take on alcohol can be positive – there are plenty of pieces of art, poems, songs, and movies where people are genuinely happy, toasting, joking, laughing, being happy, relishing booze. On the other hand, alcohol can relax people, heighten the conviviality of the gathering, taste good, and transport people to a most pleasurable state. So I would say a commonality of the ones you picked is not that alcohol caused their problems; they had problems, and are drinking perhaps to feel better, but without success; and from what we know of alcohol, in fact it will probably make things worse – which segues to your scientific information.  the supposition is that alcohol brings happiness and pleasure and gregariousness.

**Cause and Effect**:  Another paradox of alcohol lurks in these four works: the ambiguity of cause and effect. From these brief vignettes, we cannot glean whether drinking too much has significantly caused their current malaises, or whether the vicissitudes of life have driven the characters to drink. Are these broken people or people broken by drinking?  Either way, many people recognize the spiral downward that may result from downing too much alcohol. 

**Moderation and Tradeoffs*: As a group, the alcoholic symbols and suggestions in these works hint at  alcohol’s risk and reward trade-offs. Indulging in moderation in the right circumstances strikes a balance between the pleasures of drinking and the possible repercussions.  A stimulating sense of risk and adventure may come from downing too much, because they then slip into a perception of heightened powers, creativity or attractiveness. That reward, however, also plagues them if they drink too much with risks of harming their body, their relationships, or others physically. “Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but the bible says love your enemy.” (Frank Sinatra, from a [site with drinking quotes.](https://drinkade.com/blogs/news/35-famous-drinking-quotes)

The more you ponder these connotations of alcohol in our society, the more you realize the English language spills over with colloquial expressions for overdoing: cockeyed, hammered, inebriated, out of it smashed, tipsy, toasted.  They all point to the same conclusion:  Drinking profoundly alters an individual’s mood, behavior, and neuropsychological functioning. 


Note 1.  Someone who is drunk to the point of being unable to stand up straight. The ‘sheets’ here refer to the sails of a windmill rather than bed linen. Windmill operators used to add or remove the number of sails according to the strength of the wind.  One basic rule that they had to follow was to always keep an even number of sails – either two or four – opposite each other in order to keep the windmill balanced and steady. [According to an English usage site](https://www.ecenglish.com/learnenglish/lessons/why-do-we-say-three-sheets-wind), if they ever had only three sheets out, the windmill became unstable and extremely wobbly, swaying from side to side very much like someone who has enjoyed a little too much alcohol!
