The subthemes of Money discussed above arise from a [a poem about poverty and true friends](Money), a painting from a [town market](Pork), the lament of a [poor boy in love](Town), and a movie about [raw greed and financial chicanery](Wall). We have a few more subthemes to present that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Miscellaneous Subthemes**:  Among the subsidiary topics we could have addressed regarding money, here are several:  (i) allowances for children; (ii) Savings Bonds, 529 education accounts, 401(k)-3 accounts, and pensions; (iii) parts or all of the financial system writ large; (iv) crypto-currencies such as BitCoin and Ethereum; (v) the national debt, as the United States has borrowed nearly \$30 trillion dollars by issuing Treasury bonds; and (vi) clothing accessories for money, including wallets, purses, money clips, and money belts.  

**Records**:  Superlatives about money surround us.  The few collected here give a sense of what could be compiled.

**Expressions**:   Below are a wealth of figurative sayings that relate to money.
