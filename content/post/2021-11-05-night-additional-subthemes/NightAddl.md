The subthemes of Night discussed above were animated by a [a poem about surmounting the dark of life](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-11-05-night-from-invictus-a-poem-by-william-ernest-henley/nightinvictus/), a painting from a [sleepy town](starry) ablaze with stars overhead, a recognition in song of the [power of support](stand), and a movie with [comic night scenes](https://themesfromart.com/post/2021-11-05-night-from-it-happened-one-night-a-movie-starring-clark-gable-and-claudette-colbert/nighthappened/). Here are two more subthemes that don’t link so directly to any of the four works of art.

**Records**:  Superlatives about night are not as easy to find as for other subthemes.  A few are collected here.

Shortest night:  In the northernmost city in Alaska, Utqiaġvik, the sun stays above the horizon for about 82 days, from around May 11 to August 1.  In the northernmost town in the world, Ny-Ålesund, on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, the Midnight Sun lasts for 131 days or so, from about April 17 to August 26.   [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/midnight-sun.html)

Darkest period of night:  Whenever the sun is more than 18 degrees below the horizon, which depends on your latitude and the date. The period of darkness is distributed equally either side of midnight.  [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-time-is-the-night-usually-darkest-Assuming-its-a-cloudless-night-then-around-what-time-it-would-be-darkest-Is-it-correct-to-say-night-is-darkest-before-dawn)

Brightest star: Sirius, the “Dog Star,” in winter; Arcturus, the brightest star in the constellation of Bootes, The Herdsman, during the summer, which is the fourth-brightest star visible from Earth.  [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2021/08/14/whats-the-brightest-star-in-the-summer-night-sky-no-its-not-the-north-star/)

Number of stars visible by naked eye:  The night sky here is rated a Bortle scale 4 (rural dark sky).”  the upper end of estimates total about 10,000 visible stars. Other estimates place the number at more like 5,000.  [Earth Sky](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/how-many-stars-could-you-see-on-a-clear-moonless-night/)

Brightest lighthouse:  The Phare du Créac'h, on the island of Ouessant, in France and the "new" Cape Point Lighthouse in South Africa are both visible for 60km, or about 37 miles.  [U.S. Lighthouses](https://www.us-lighthouses.com/faq.php)

Brightness of the sun:  For each square meter on Earth, our sun lavishes 127,000 lumens.  16.24 quintillion lumens of sunlight hit here every second [Kogalla](https://kogalla.com/blogs/tech-trail/how-many-lumens-is-the-sun).

Brightest event in the universe:  A super-luminous supernova is a type of stellar explosion with a luminosity 10 or more times higher than that of standard supernovae.[1]  In June 2018, AT2018cow was detected and found to blaze 10–100 times brighter than a normal supernova.

**Expressions**:  Below are a few score figurative sayings that relate to Night.  For a master list of online sources that have contributed idioms to the various Themes, see Work Additional Subthemes(  ).  For this collection of 60, aside from identifying candidate expressions myself, I drew heavily on [The Free Dictionary](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/night).
