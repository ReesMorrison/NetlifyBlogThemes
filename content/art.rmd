Through Silence, posted on April 8, 2021, Themes from Art has discussed seven themes, eliciting subthemes from one poem, movie, rock song, and impressionist painting for each theme, a total of 28 artistic works.  The table below lists each of them by genre.

The second table groups the artistic works by theme.

```{r packages, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```


```{r artTable, echo=FALSE}

art <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "C:/Users/Rees Morrison/Documents/R/Projects/CLIENTS/Themes/Art and Artists.xlsx")

artTable <- kableExtra::kable(art)

artTable  # by genre and then chrono

artTablebyTheme <- art %>% arrange(Theme)

artTable.tab <- kableExtra::kable(artTablebyTheme)

artTable.tab # by theme

```
